       "'if you be hesitate to watch this at all , please .... just throw out your reservation and watch this . Goblin have just make my favorite list . even my husband got suck in and love this show . the cinematography be gorgeous , the music be amazing , the actor be perfect ( hello , Gong Yoo ! ) , the story be heartbreakingly beautiful . this be the first time I \\'ve watch any of the main actor except Yoo in Na . I have now officially develop a Gong Yoo crush and understand why drama fan be enamored of he .   Gong Yoo as Kim Shin/ Goblin be mesmerizing . I could listen to his voice for day . every scene he be in be a treat . every emotion that his character have be palpable , and his smile could light up the sky . and Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak be super cute . she have a lot of detractor and the writer get a lot of flak for make she so young . but the character and her age be perfect for this story and how it unfold . Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper have the perfect deadpan ( heh ) delivery . and he may be the good male \" crier \" I \\'ve see yet . the story will make you laugh and make you cry . not only be the love story epic , but so be the bromance between Goblin and Reaper . I \\'ve find that I be quite fond of this fantasy genre and this have be do so well . I have hardly any criticism of this show at all because even the flaw fade into nothing noticeable for I . it be sweet , funny , romantic , sad , tragic , beautiful ... the music be perfect and perfectly lovely . I do n\\'t always pay much attention to the music , but this show utilize it so well and choose the perfect song . so many people love even the intro song that they make a special recording of it to make it a full length song ( Round and Round , but may also be find under never far away ) . beautiful by Crush be the good song in my opinion , and I believe that it be the theme song for our main couple . and stay with I by Chanyeol and Punch be another favorite . rewatch value be high - if not everything , then there be many , many favorite scene that I \\'ll go back to and relive the feel . :) I feel compel to write a review for Goblin because I be find all the perfect 10 to be misleading and , if I can be honest , completely confounding . let I first say the good thing about Goblin be the acting . the cast be fantastic . the bad be the age gap . I know most people talk about the age of the actor ; however , the issue to those of we that have a problem with the age be n\\'t the actor , it be the character .   the lead female character be a 19 year old girl . the lead male ( take out the fantasy of his live 938 year ) be a grown man who appear almost 40 . personally , I find that the Korean \\'s have be dance too close to the line in the young girl with adult man in drama for at least a year now and I be not a fan . they be more daddy issue character . there be many time when the   relationship between the 2 lead be most like Father & daughter . she speak to he like a father figure . and he speak to she as a child . it be off put when it become clear that he have fall for this high school girl . part of I believe the part of Kim Shin ( the Goblin ) be write for a young man . consider the life expectancy of the period and his postion , in his late 30 he should have have a wife ( and concubine I would guess ) and child . I think the character should have be at least 10 year young ( again the 900 year undead aside ) .   the romance of the lead just do not work for I on any level . conversely , the romance between the support be a completely different story . it be endearing and very moving . I root for they . the writing be inconsistent .   it be great in some part and just passable in other . toward the end it almost turn into melodramatic schlock .   Goblin work well as a bromance .   the scene between Goblin , Reaper(s ) , and the male human be precious golden nugget to hold onto until the next time 2 or 3 of they be in a scene together .   have the writer hold on to that chemistry and nourish it , Goblin would have be much well . it must be say that Goblin be very much a somewhat cliché rom - com disguise itself as something else , but ultimately , what appear to be an interesting premise be cast aside for a romantic plot that I be go to be honest be a little creepy and at time feel very fatherly to I . this make it very hard to love the romance especially when the female lead be a bubble of cutesy energy and also she borderline look twelve . there be moment I want to run into the scene and tell Gong Yoo , you get the hell away from she and date someone your own age . yes , that , 782 age gap be at time hard to swallow . what make Goblin good be it be feature . it star longing look , teary - eyed longing look , bromance , ignore that he be 800 year old , try to pretend you be not watch this because of the bromance and good look lead and KES \\'s obligatory three good episode towards the end that make you think this be so good . it also star a very good performance by Lee Dong Wook . I \\'d like to say the rest of the cast be just as good , but I \\'d be lie . Gong Yoo be someone , I watch because he be in good movie ( the Crucible / silence , etc ) but not because he give an actual good performance . he be like a Brad Pitt type in that regard . I be quite surprised by LDW as I find he heavily attractive and have for a long time but I \\'ve admit he be a terrible actor . suddenly he be Matthew McConaughaying I . the female lead be literally a copy paste of all rom - com . especially from this writer . the intro of this drama be unique and create what have the potential to be a very good plot , but ultimately this be a meander slow stream of a journey that I heavily recommend you skip some episode . yes , skip from ep 5 to 13 and you \\'ll miss very little . the juicy part of the plot be throw aside for a slew of teary - eyed longing look and cliché romantic scene that at ep 4 , I start to wonder when they be actually go to focus on the juicy premise . character wise , the bromance sell this stale plot as personally , the romance between the male and female lead just look awkward . I should be gush at romantic scene but they look as uncomfortable as I do and when Gong Yoo pat her head , he at time feel like her father . the drama have a lot of potential but the writer do n\\'t seem to know what to do with it and I feel like a traitor who deserve to be hang for say this , but as a huge lover of bromance , dare I say it , I actually get bored of the bromance . I start tune in to cast longing look at Lee Dong Wook . my obsession make I run out into the street and jump in front of a car , but I heavily recommend you do n\\'t do that as the Grim Reaper never appear and now I be write this in the afterlife . the writer here also insert she I suckere you into think this be good by have her obligatory three good episode that make I think , oh this have potential . it be always towards the end too . melancholic episode with good editing that make I wonder where be this for the previous ten episode ? I feel the drama be a seven at good as in , I would be very generous to give it a 7 . it have its good melancholic and humorous scene but it ultimately never quite get its pacing right and never seem to know what to focus on make this really not as good as it could be . PS . I also urge you to cast aside any logical question you might have especially towards the end . they will not be answer . every moment of it indeed shined!goblin be a great drama . I go into it with low expectation , but I be pleasantly surprised , or more accurately ,   I be blow away . you can recognize a good drama by the way it make you feel exactly what the character in the drama be feel . that be the way Goblin be for I , with each character , I laugh and I cry . I\\'ll try to keep the review sweet and short , so here be the reason I enjoy Goblin:-The premise be unique . it be one of a kind . I have n\\'t see any other Kdramas with a similar plot - line to Goblin , so that be a plus point.-the actor do a superb job . I could feel their emotion from across the screen . then again , nothing less to be expect from such a spectacular cast.-the drama have everything , range from bromance , romance to mystery and suspense.-the bromance be spectacular . one of the most epic bromance I \\'ve ever see in a Kdrama . it make I laugh a lot , but it also have its heartwarming and heart - wrench moment . Goblin and Grim Reaper \\'s relationship be one of the good reason to pick this up.-the two couples- Goblin & Eun Tak and Grim Reaper & sunny . both couple have their own story . the sweet and cute moment of the Goblin couple & the sizzling chemistry between Grim Reaper and sunny be enough to keep the \\' romance \\' meter of the drama pretty high . you wo n\\'t be able to get enough of the cuteness of Goblin & Eun Tak.-The mystery of the character . from \\' the lady in red \\' to the king and queen , each episode just give enough glimpse into their life to keep we engrossed . it \\'ll drive you crazy in a good way.-each minute of every episode be enjoyable . I do n\\'t skip a single moment of any episode.-the unexpectedness of the drama be really great . just when you \\'d think you have something figure out , some twist would come along and surprise you . the writer sure do a tremendous job . bonu : beautiful and addictive OSTI personally do n\\'t find anything even remotely bad about it , but that be not to say other people wo n\\'t , so here be a few thing you should keep in mind before venture into it.-The age difference between Goblin [ ( ~939 ) he be 39 when he die and then immortal for 900 year ] and Eun Tak ( 19).-comparatively less screen time for sunny and grim Reaper couple . but I suppose that be to be expect specially since the title alone indicate that Kim Shin ( Goblin ) be the main lead , so it be no wonder they get the most screen time.-Worst product placement you \\'ll ever see in a Kdrama . you might think I be kid but sometimes even the small thing can annoy you . I personally find those scene amusing though . so , to sum up- I love this drama ! do give this one a chance , you wo n\\'t be disappoint . once you start it , chance be , you \\'ll end up love it . happy Watching!Somewhere inside Goblin , bury under a mound of PPL and tear , be a good show try to get out . the first two episode suggest what might have be , deftly mix intense action and off - beat humor in a dark world fill with ominous reaper , wound goblin , ghost - see teenager and cabbage - wield grannie . the stage seem set for a life and death clash of epic proportion . alas , it soon become apparent that the writer forget to include an antagonist . the goblin - reaper face - off devolve into a chummy bromance , leave \" fate \" to play the role of spoiler . unfortunately , it ’ hard to fight disembodied destiny . whole episode be spend weep in pretty scenery and eat subway sandwich . the talented cast try to up the urgency , but with nothing tangible to battle , the pacing slow to a crawl . the extended episode length and the director ’s tendency to linger a little too long on every moment exacerbate the problem . even the romance falter on the uncomfortable age gap between the protagonist . every so often . interesting idea pop up about guilt , redemption , and the role of kindness in a cosmos more random than rewarding . alas , the fickle god that rule this universe stay above the fray . a drama that actually allow its character to take they on rather than simply lament their cruelty could have be powerful indeed . I be go to give it a 7 but there be too many thing that bother I , too many plot hole . I enjoy watch this drama more time than not . it be relax to look at , with the great cinematography and breathtaking scenery . music be great and very fitting . the actor be more or less very fitting in their role and feel natural . the chemistry between the male cast be flawless . I guess my main and only issue here be the writing . there be two type of supernatural drama : the one that explore human emotion through the supernatural ; and the one that use it to tell your usual story . I think Goblin be somewhere in between . I still appreciate some point of the writing . what I dislike be the plot as a whole . I like the overall idea but not the execution . I like the idea of supernatural and powerful being , like ghost , goblin , grim reaper and god , be live normally among human without be notice . I like the story of the little boy we meet early in the drama to see his fate and effect on the Goblin ( and vice versa ) . I love the heartfelt story of Eun Tak \\'s ghost friend , and enjoy the company of the group of Ahjuma ghost . what I greatly dislike be the way the main story arc be handle . at first it feel overly dramatic , but later it feel so underwhelming that it remove and intensity feel before . when it end the way it do , I feel there be no point to the whole story . essentially be back to point zero . I think the writer have some original idea , but no gut to go deeply . as a result interesting topic be touch lightly , but never go beyond , hence feel shallow . I wish more time be spend in explore the world , get more concrete information on how demon be create and how to deal with they . instead you just follow the character \\' daily life of not do much , and supernatural element be just use as a convenience . when it come to romance , I do n\\'t care much about the age difference due to the supernatural part of it , but I just do n\\'t enjoy it , I do n\\'t feel it . I do n\\'t know when it happen . also Goblin be beyond childish . he be too moody and unbearable at time . while I be more invest into the secondary couple , I still feel the same , as in a missing episode of they go out and truly fall in love with each other be missing . I do n\\'t like the way both couple go . the non - romance relationship be great . the bromance , there be more than plenty . it be perfect . the focus and the grow relationship feel authentic and real . I also love the relationship between Grim Reaper and Eun Tak . I do enjoy Deok Hwa \\'s presence , but man be he so underused!other thing that bother I but not necessarily cause any deduction to the rating be over the top product placement . at one point it look like subway be about to save the world , one sandwich at a time . and the wardrobe of poor little female lead , I just wonder how she manage to fit all those clothe in such little luggage and how she can afford they . I love how they present Quebec at first , but I get mad that they do n\\'t try to be accurate as to how the city look at this time of the year . bad of all be the episode length . it be needlessly long . I do n\\'t regret watch this drama . I still have a great time watch . although the last three episode feel too draggy and less enjoyable , but it still have some good moment . well all moment with GR for I be great lol . enjoy ! and do n\\'t hate I too much for the rating : PMy reason for watch this show be a ) because of all the hype and b ) because of Kim Go Eun who I like in cheese in the trap . unfortunately it turn out to be a great disappointment . there be not much depth to the story and to be honest I do n’t care much for any of the character . for a man who have live for 900 + year , Kim Shin have about as much maturity as a 16 year old boy . moreover , the lead pair be terribly mismatched . a young look actor might ’ve be well suited . if this be real life , I would go so far as to think that Ji Eun Tak be a vulnerable girl who love goblin only because he be someone that pay attention to she and take care of she . not exactly the good reason to love someone . that say , not all be bad with the show . I enjoy watch the second pair as well as Deok Hwa . I be never a fan of Yoo in Na in her previous work but I think she do a good job here . as do Lee Dong Wook and Sung Jae . music be pleasant to listen to . I especially like \" stay with Me” . the good part of the show be the cinematography . maybe I have a bit of a soft corner since Quebec be my home province . but I must say , they do a wonderful job shoot around the Chateau Frontenac and surrounding . the Goryeo scene be good too . rewatch value be none since the first watch be painful enough . for such thin plot line , what be the need to have 1.5 hour episode ? tight editing or few episode might have make the show a bit more bearable . watch if you ’re curious like I be , because of the hype . but I would not recommend it . my review will be short and sweet with a link to my very extend review at the bottom if you wish to do some extra curricular reading!The Good:1 ) Reaper and Goblin \\'s Bromance2 ) Soni and Reaper \\'s Relationship3 ) the theme song4 ) the cinematography5 ) the location shoot inand that be ALL!The UGLY:1 ) 60 % of the episode be completely plotless.2 ) the last 5 or so episode be completely rush with about 6 major plot point in each of them3 ) the cringey , over - obvious product placement4 ) EunDak be the bad character ever . she be so selfish and so stupid and she get so lazy once the boy take her in.5 ) Eun Dak and Goblin \\'s relationship should not be romantic . it would \\'ve be much well as a Father / daughter realtionship6 ) the editing be rough in a lot of parts7 ) Deok Hwa \\'s character be so undeveloped and so underused . he deserve better!8 ) the lack of relationship and character development for all of they actually9 ) the ending be an absolute mess . why do the not all die so they could start over again?!10 ) so many scene feel half do . I feel like so much be either not film or just simply edit out and I feel like I be miss whole chunk of scene that be needed.11 ) the over the top ridiculousness such as the SnowBoard accident , and the Goblin push EunDak and cause massive problem in the car park scene . those scene be so stupid . those scene be far beyond be able to suspend disbelief.12 ) completely ruin Soni and Reaper \\'s personality and all their charm in their new life in the final episode.13 ) rush through the final . those last 15 or so minute deserved and entire episode . not the rush through that it get . the excessive overhype this show get . it be really not that good . if you really want my essay - long review of this show , check it out here : http://sambart93.tumblr.com/post/179925136539/dokkaebi-goblin-its-not-bad-but-its-not-goodI be sorry but I think this drama be overrate . I know most of people be give 10 , so I think it be importante that I post a more critical review . please do n\\'t hate me!yes the actor be good , the cinematography be great and the music also . there be clearly a big budget and the special effect be awesome fo a tv drama . but despite all of that , even if the main plot be interesting , the rythme be extremely slow and all of each episode be flashback scene over and over again . I find myself nearly sleep while watch this . and I do not like the main couple ( the 2nd one be really touch on the other hand ) . why ? well in my opinion the age cap be too much ( not the actor but the character in the way they be write ) , she be speak to Gong Yoo like he be her father and she be act really like a teenager , I find this disturbing . conclusion , yes it be a good drama but for I the lack of action and the slowness of it be not compensate by the rest of the positive points.the acting be perfect . the shooting angle be great . they use the music exactly where it should be . the two love story in the story be also fascinating . the character be handle very well . there be nothing I do n\\'t like in this story . those who do not watch this drama will definitely feel missing . I be so sorry that the drama be already over . you should call the goblin as the master of all asian series . without a doubt , goblin be the good asian drama ever made.!!!!oh grim reaper . oh my love at first gong yoo seem to be the lead role , but it be n\\'t all . as I say , the character be think through to every fine detail and convey to we by the actor in the most accurate way . comedy and tragedy be very well do . it be a drama that I both cry and laugh a lot.absolutely everyone should watch ... ! ! ! ! ! ! it be a very good drama , but by faaaaar not one of the best.(truthfully speak , lately folk on MDL just throw around the 10 , it be totally misleading.)the good about this drama , be by a long shot , the acting . superb . the male lead and the second female lead be the outstanding star for I - you could feel their sorrow and mood and they do not overact . and the male lead have a tough part to act , because ...... the freakin \\' age gap ! it make I cringe sometimes . I just could n\\'t overlook it , no matter how hard I try . sure , 19 and around 39 ( or : 939 ) be not a total disaster , but it do come close to be inappropriate , especially since the female lead be write to be extremely teenagery , show lot of little - girl - aspect . although the kissing scene be really great and believable in themselves , the issue with the age just make it awkward to watch . anyways . the plot , not to forget , be okay , sometimes even really nice . the ending be really emotional and I like it , because I do not expect it . ( it squeeze even two tear out of I , and I be one of those viewer that never cry ) . the issue here be , that there be sometimes weird jump between very , very serious topic and total slapstick . it be rather unusual and it make it sometimes difficult to follow the mood . the other thing be that in each episode there be several time that I be outright bored . if you look at it from afar , there be not much plot go on besides the two lead couple circle around each other . be it a good drama ? yes . be it a great drama ? no . this drama be extremely overrated . it be boring . from the premise , it seem original , but its just a generic k - drama romance full of cliche . the main girl be extremely immature and I find the age gap quite worrying . I do not find she too annoying as some people have say , she could be the kind of girl find in high school ( still though her immaturity be exaggerated ) . it be the relationship between her character and the Goblin I disliked- it just do n\\'t work . the romance do not feel real or believable . it feel like a father and daughter , but we be suppose to believe they be in love . it seem like I would especially enjoy it because of the historical / fantasy aspect , which be genre I love , but these be only very small part of the drama . although I do expect these to be only small part , I do n\\'t enjoy the rest of the drama anyway . I find myself want to skip lot or sometimes feel like I be fall asleep . the plot skip ahead often and feel a bit all over the place , as if the writer do n\\'t really know what they be do . I constantly find myself frustrated and bored with the story . in say that I love the part involve the Grim Reaper , and his relationship with the Goblin and sunny , and when the fantasy / historical element do appear I enjoy they . the acting be also very good . however , overall I do not enjoy this drama and would not recommend it unless you like watch generic , boring romance with poor writing ( or watch it and skip all of the main romance- lmao).story : the idea as a theme of the story be good , unique and different . but it be actually a spider web to trap I to go inside and watch it . I personally dislike the relationship between male and female lead after episode 3 . it be damn annoying to see this girl . I have 0 patience with this kind of girl . Matrealistic , selfish and demanding . all of characteristic that I do n\\'t like . the bromance be sweet and funny so it have save the story in general . some scene be still questionable , even the male lead character change so abruptly from a great war general to a silly childish guy after meet a teenage girl for a few day . the beginning of the plot be so slow with so many flashback and unnecessary scene . second lead female be redundant ( which be a pity ) from ep 1 - 10 , like she get so little scene in the drama besides those flashback and sit in the empty shop . I would say this drama will be very good if its only about   6 - 8 episode . there be too many filler in the drama ( which be understandable ) probably to get more money from advertisement to cover big budget . music ? ? ? ? music be good . I admit it . I like all the song in   this drama . it be very catchy and refreshing . CinematographyIt be good . editing team be expert in this . it have cinematography like movie . the color be solid , the background , house , shoot venue , fashion style , everything be nice . I can tell that it have a big production budget . acting be okay . I can relate . it be not make I feel weird . just some character write by the writer that make I feel strange . overall , I know this be a good drama , I mean most of the aspect be good . but sadly , I appreciate movie and drama base on the story and character development . since the story be not good enough for I , the drama have big flaw in my eye . sorry , I   have high expectation after I watch 1st episode that I become so disappointed with the rest of the episode . especially the middle one . but I would recommend this drama for u to watch if u do n\\'t mind of the strange romance that feel forceful for I , this be a drama for u.ohh I need to mention it again , I hate the female lead character , ok . story : this be probably the most inventive and creative drama / story plot I \\'ve see in the korean entertainment industry yet ! I adore fantasy because it strike the imagination part of the brain in a fun way and I \\'ve see some fantasy - genre korean drama but they do n\\'t involve a lot of fantasy element . Most drama I \\'ve see that be label as \" fantasy \" or \" supernatural \" usually use these element to support a story . they be more tool to carry the story along rather than be the main focus . \\' Queen in Hyun \\'s Man \\' be the close I \\'ve see to make fantasy as the main focus point , but still lack emphasis on the genre . this drama really make the \" fantasy \" element the main focus and you see the story support the genre rather than the other way around . I be so proud and happy for Kim Eun Sook . she do a fantastic job write this drama ! the world she create be so vivid and realistic in the sense that if there be such thing as goblin and grim reaper in this world , she make the idea fit into our \\' real world \\' construct to make it believable that they might actually exist . I think it be unique to have the idea that there be many grim reaper , instead of just one , and that they be organize in a governmental way . the reason for their amnesia be pretty sound and the search for the goblin \\'s bride be pretty inventive . Kim Eun Sook could \\'ve be lazy with the why of everything and make they the most conventional reason possible , but she definitely take great stride into create a story that weave in and out with every action and every decision so that almost everything have a meaning and a real reason behind they .   Kim Eun Sook do a sublime job flesh out the character too ! they definitely be n\\'t the cookie - cutter type of character you usually see in almost all romance korean drama , and I super appreciate that ! it get soooooooo unbelievably boring when I see the same type of character over and over again in every typical romance drama . especially the male character . they always turn out to be super mean and only to the main female character , but have a hard time express their feeling from their golden heart . -__- ! ! act / CAST : this have be the good casting I \\'ve see ever ! I be not even joke ! my favorite actress ( for the current time ) be Kim Go Eun and even though she be still young in the industry , she have amazing acting talent ! she pull off her character without a hitch . same go for Gong Yoo , who be a veteran in the entertainment industry and bring flourish of experience from his time in the k - drama and k - movie business . Lee Dong Wook also do surprisingly well in this drama , although I still wish he be a bit more expressive . maybe I \\'ll get some upset comment about this , but he always seem to have this same indifferent look about he in every drama I \\'ve see he in . but still , he do great in this drama , despite this fact . I consider Yoo in Na as a bit of a newbie in the entertainment business , but   glad she get to be in this drama because I definitely see good potential to grow her act talent and be a very talented actress . also have to give prop to Yook Sung Jae and Lee El for their great portrayal of our god . Lee El have really good potential to be a great actress as well and hope that after be expose in this drama , she \\'ll have the opportunity to be in many more drama as well . maybe in a lead ? she be always be the side character , haha!MUSIC : I do n\\'t really pick on the music unless it be extremely good or extremely ill - fitting . Goblin \\'s soundtrack be absolutely perfect ! it fit the tone of the drama so perfectly and carry the emotional and lighthearted scene so perfectly ! this be one of those rare moment where I want to download the whole track list to my phone so that I can listen to it whenever and where ever ! what people do n\\'t often notice be that the music of a drama and the story be kind of like two half of a whole . they really do have to fit well together or else the overall picture / concept of the drama become a little .... off . but these two fit together absolutely perfectly!OVERALL : I be go into this drama with big apprehension because the writer be Kim Eun Sook , who also write Descendants of the Sun , which I be absolutely bored to tear with . with the awesome cast in this drama but with Kim Eun Sook be the writer , I be worried that she would do the same thing as she do with dots . but I be thankfully relieve and pleasantly surprised ! I know I sing praise up and down in this review for this drama , but please keep in mind that I rarely ever do this unless it demand that kind of praise . there be really only one other drama I give a 9/10 or above and that be Liar Game ( korean version ) . this drama be well - direct , well - act , and put together so well and so impressively that I really ca n\\'t help say nothing but great thing about it ! the only reason why I give this drama 9.5/10 instead of 10/10 be because of \\' the contract \\' reasoning for our goblin ( do n\\'t think that be a spoiler because you \\'d have to watch and know what the contract be ) but other than that little lazy reasoning , usually , I leave about a week to review a drama because I do n\\'t want the add hype of my own excitement to affect a review , but I be very confidant that my thought and feeling for this drama will not waver for the reason I write in this review , even as time pass . I would wholeheartedly watch this again and again ! the cast , the story , and the music all blend and mesh together so well that it be paint the most beautiful picture I \\'ve see yet!note : this be a somewhat slow - pace drama , so please understand that before watch . some people do n\\'t like slow - pace because of our tendency to want instant gratification ( especially with the young folk , haha ) but to be honest , this drama would n\\'t have do so well if it be more fast - pace . I think be slow - pace as it be be the perfect speed for the story . if it be any fast , we \\'d be leave with a less desirable ending and very rushed story . okay , here be the thing : Goblin be a drama sooooooo many people love . it be say to be such a great drama . it take I really long to watch it , simply because I be an anti - hype girl . I never read or watch thing while they be be hype , as I do n\\'t want my view to be somehow clouded . but then at some point , I \\'ll probably watch or read it nevertheless . that be how it be with Goblin . and I honestly look forward to it because it be suppose to be such a great drama . boy , be I wrong . here be why . story : the story be basically a great idea ! a Goblin who need his bride to be redeem . his bride be a High School girl , that he once save , who see ghost . wait , what ? ! an ancient guy and a High School girl ? Oooooookay .... I think , well , maybe they just meet once while she be in High School and then they meet year later to fall in love . well , no . that be not what happen . the story be reaaaaaaallllllyyyyyy slow pace and with that at some point it be just drag on and on and on and on and I think \\xa0 \" move ! forward ! \" but that do not happen until the last two or so episode . Meeh -.-The only thing that make this slow story well be the story line between the Grim Reaper and sunny . I would have love to have they as the main couple and tell their story rather than the Goblin \\'s story . act / cast : I have n\\'t watch any drama with Gong Yoo or Lee Dong Wook before , wo I be open to anything that might come along the way . they both act fantastically but I be just so irritated with Gong Yoo \\'s role . he be constantly go on my nerve act like a spoiled little child . some scene , especially in the beginning be really funny and I get some weird glance from my husband because I burst out in laughter several time . but after some time the Goblin become really annoying . the grim Reaper on the other hand have a lot of depth and he be a fascinating character through and through . now on to the girl , I watch Kim Go Eun in \" cheese in the Trap \" and Yoo in Na in \" my love from another star \" and I like both of they . here they also do a pretty alright job . but due to this slow pace story I could n\\'t enjoy there act much . a huge praise go to Yook Sung Jae , he be hilarious and so damn cute!also , I would have love to see more scene with Kim so Hyun and Kim Min Jae - they look so freaking good together ! can they please get a drama where they be the otp!?!?music : now that be the amazing part of the drama - the music . Alsways spot on and so so beautiful ! together with the scenery - wow!rewatch value : I would give a 0 if I could . will never rewatch this . overall : it could have be amazing ! unfortunately it be n\\'t . not at all . TLDR : I be give this a 7/10 for the fabulous cinematography and the excellent bromance . why I like it:1 . the cinematography be LOVE LOVE LOVE . I want to go visit Canada now.2 . the bromance.3 . grim Reaper \\'s deadpan sense of humor . so my thing.4 . Gong Yoo have never look hot . ( okay , that be not quite true . he be always hot.)5 . Goblin \\'s pettiness.6 . sunny \\'s character . I like her lot . what I dislike about it:1 . too . damn . long . too many scene linger on unnecessary beat and they stretch scene that be n\\'t at all integral to the plot . the premise have so much promise but it be n\\'t use to its full potential.2 . Kim Go - eun \\'s cutesy act . I like she as an actress and she be fab in the dramatic scene but she tend to overdo the aegyo . it do n\\'t help that her character be ... confusing . she be suppose to be intelligent and quite mature , and the next she do absolutely imbecilic thing . SMH.3 . I do n\\'t quite buy the romance between the millenia - old dokkaebi and his high schooler bride.4 . that ending . I be ambivalent about it . in all the Kdramas that I have watch , Goblin will probably be the one that I will remember the most . the acting be brilliant , the chemistry be outstanding ( good bromance in history of Kdrama between Gong Yoo and LDW ) , and the music be so good that when you hear it outside of the show , you will immediately think of goblin . a song in particular that be in my head \\' till now be I miss you ( grim Reaper and sunny \\'s theme song ) . would have give it a perfect 10 , but they fail to properly conclude the show ; the ending can be consider bland and unfinished from all the butterfly , heartbreak , and laughter the show give we . overall however , I would still recommend this show for everyone to watchSo far , a lot of korean drama I \\'ve watch follow what I call the 90 - 10 rule . 90 percent of the plot will be a romantic comedy fill with light and fluffy moment while the other 10 percent will be focus on the theme that give the drama its identity .   Goblin follow this rule to a tee where most of the story involve the character act funny or cute with each other . the rest involve deal with their life as supernatural being , couple with occasional flashback of a previous life hundred of year ago . I\\'m not sure if I can call this a flaw . I know a lot of viewer love this sort of thing and there be nothing wrong with prefer the lighthearted and none - too - heavy in term of plot . I know it can be a great stress reliever as well . I prefer my drama more on the plot heavy side though ; even the most romantic story I like have about \\' 50 percent of something - else - going - on - other - than - the - romance . \\' but for what it be worth , Goblin be extremely successful as a rom - com . I just happen to be more interested in the supernatural or dramatic part of it . for I , the most interesting scene where when Eun Tak have to deal with the ghost she could see , when Grim Reaper have to transport the dead one drama at a time and when a deity or god would pop up in the story to mess with the character . overall , Goblin be an adorable little show but it could have be much big . I love the world that it introduce I to . a world where grim Reapers would meet and convene on their deadly assignment , where goblin could make gold out of nothing and where special people ( like Eun Tak ) could help the dead get over their unfinished business . I wish there could have be more of that .   be the Goblin ( the main character ) the only Goblin in the world ? be there other like he ? there be moment where I want to see more of what make a Goblin special ( and how they be able to tie this korean fantasy creature to a modern day adaptation ) and what he could do to make people \\'s life more magical .   while his telekinetic fight scene with Reaper be adorable , I kind of wish to see his power put to well use . I want his \\' Goblin persona \\' to make the story more interesting .   this drama offer a tantalizing glimpse of a supernatural world in the modern age but there be so very little of it :( now the chemistry between the OTP be fine . I feel that they have their good moment in the last two episode ( where the drama really make it worthwhile and where I finally get the Gong Yu hype ! ) but the early episode ( all 14 to be exact ) be somewhat boring for I because the development of their relationship consist mostly of : goblin :   \\' oh can she see the sword in my chest ? \\' , \\' will she pull it out ? \\' \\' oh , I need she to get it out of I \\' , \\' oh , I do n\\'t want she to pull it out now!\\'Eun Tak ; \\' be I the Goblin \\'s bride ? \\' \\' oh , I wo n\\'t pull the sword out for some reason \\' \\' oh , I want to pull it out but he wo n\\'t let I \\' , \\' oh , now I know what will happen if it gets pull out I be never go to do it- how could he ask I to!\\'that be basically what their relationship dynamic be like for most of the show .   I much preferred grim Reaper and Sunny \\'s dynamic because it touch on the difficulty of a Reaper / human relationship well . the Reaper \\'s past be also more intriguing because it explain why he be doom to such a fate . in the Goblin \\'s ( aka Kim Shin ) case , the immortal life he be give be mean to be a reward but it play out more like a punishment . this make no sense to I because in the very first * episode , his past life as a noble warlord be establish . he be betray , he commit no crime whatsoever ... so every time the god would make thing difficult for he ... every time the story would make he suffer ... these consequence do n\\'t really fit in with the logic of reward - punishment the story be try to make . the character be blameless so the suffering he go through have no basis and feel hollow to I . other thing I take note off : Gong Yu be n\\'t the good actor but his charisma as a lead man be appeal . I do n\\'t get it until the very last episode ( this be where the romantic angle finally work out for I and the OTP moment become squee worthy ) ; I just wish it happen soon ; 0i like the actress play Eun Tak . but the problem I have be that the director tell she to act too childlike . I get that the whole \\' naive and innocent \\' candy girl be a staple in these drama ... but her version be too exaggerated and go way beyond the trope . I \\'ve watch ( and appreciate ) plenty of other candy girl before but Eun Tak be a little too much for I at time . she be a 19/20 year old woman and she play it like she be 13 , squeal over a bag she get as a present , jump up and down the bed and hug her stuff toy , cry in the bed while it rain outside ... the last time I see this peculiar behavior be in the Hollywood action movie take , where Liam Neeson \\'s daughter \" Kimmy \" act like a 7 year old kid instead of as a teenager / young woman .   in hindsight , perhaps it be a good thing that the OTP moment come at the later episode , as it be only then that Eun Tak start act normally -_-Lee Dong Wok may be the good actor here . he be definitely the good crier . he bring so much depth to the flawed but intriguing Reaper , who easily become my favorite character . the way he express emotion seem extremely heartfelt . now , I do n\\'t have that much familiarity with Yoo in Na ; the only other time I \\'ve see she be in my love from the Stars where she play a similar support character . but her sunny be very likable -the no - nonsense type female lead usually be . one thing Goblin excel in be that it have some of the good special effect I \\'ve see in any drama . viewer can feast their eye on some of the most beautiful landscape abroad and in Korea . the fight scene , explode car , etc . , all be great to look at . the historical part be do well , too . the OST be nice to hear but like plenty of other korean drama , when you pause to really listen to the english part in the lyrics- they do n\\'t make much sense . \" never go my way ... never quite some day ... \" what ? ! xdoverall , Goblin be a good show but it be n\\'t great . I think viewer who do n\\'t mind extremely light ( as in , \\' hardly nothing ever happen but we be all so cute anyway ! \\' ) plot would appreciate this the most . I be glad I watch this ; I feel like I can understand the hype more although I ca n\\'t participate in it as much as I would like . I decide to watch Goblin after many of my friend recommend it to I , to say the least I be disappointed . the story be full of plot hole , and in a conversation I have , no one could explain the plot hole , and say I should just enjoy it for what it be . but how be I suppose to enjoy a drama that could have explain everything in 3 episode but drag out?this be a drama that stir up my intellect more than anything else . the music for this drama be kind of blah , with all the hype , I think they would have more than 1 piece I like . for majority drama I watch , the music would be so good that I would replay the part with the music I like , but for this drama I only like 1 song they have , and it be n\\'t good enough for a replayThe main couple be awkward and boring , maybe for people who like extremely slow drama . the chemistry between they be a little and awkward , like a woman fall in love with a stalker because she have psychological problem which have n\\'t be solve , and will love anyone who give they any kind of attention . or like a man who need a needy woman to feel well about himself . within a few episode in , I could already predict the majority of the story line for the main couple . overall , their relationship can be summarize by a daughter - father relationship with romance . the only redeem thing about this drama be the support character , they have a lot more chemistry , and their story line be more interesting with unpredictable outcome . I would never re - watch this drama for the main couple , maybe for the side couple but probably not . I would n\\'t recommend anyone to watch this , but if someone really want to , than skip the part with the main couple , their relationship be really repetitive and can be explain by a girl have a daddy problem , while the man have relationship problem with woman . the most disappointing drama I watch in 2017 , way over hyped . I think people who enjoy this probably just enjoy watch a dramatic fantasy romance and not like I , who tend to overthink and find plot hole . a GUY \\'S PERSPECTIVE 101 : I have be very critical when it come to sci - fi and supernatural drama and movie because they have one of the most confusing timeline and story . that be why when I watch Goblin , I have expect a lot from it . and , honestly , I have my up and down as I watch this show . nevertheless , this be a unique masterpiece that viewer need to see as asian drama continue to go through paradigm shift . story : it start really well . as in really well hahaha . the first episode top most of the movie and other drama \\' first episode that I have watch . I have continue to like it as it show the development of the character and the relationship that they be in . however , I feel a lack of depth ( just a little ) to the story as I reach the half of it , and also , as I continue to watch it , question about the character , their statement , their action , and their memory have rise . I want they to redeem the show , and guess what ? they do . the story end not as big as the start of it , but it end with a touch in the heart . my question be also answer , komabta!ending : I really like it . especially the ending for sunny and grim Reaper . : dacting / Cast : the actor be good . however , I only want to mention these three character that I salute , and the actor that have portray the role : ( 1 ) Kim Woo Bin / Wang Yeo / grim Reaper . he be my favorite because of his sense of humor and how this sense oppose his be the deliverer of dead soul . Lee Dong Wook be really gooooood ! I ca n\\'t think of other who will fit the drama more than he . ( 2 ) Lee El . HUHUHUHUHU :\\'( every scene that she be in , I be very happy . her character show that we be never alone in this world . and Lee El be really fit for this role huhuhu she be so beautiful btw . and last , ( 3 ) sunny . her chemistry with grim Reaper be daebak ! ! ! their pair be , by far , one of the good . I like her innocence and at the same time , her strong personality . in Na be realllllllly beautiful omo please be with I hahaha I be not biased with she , but she be so good here haha . all in all , the cast display a wonderful performance . music : underrated ! it should be 14/10 HAHAHAHAHA the music be one of those that drive ME to watch this show . I don\\'t know what to say . ost here be the good ( my opinion)Rewatch value : Worth watch again . overall : drama have flaw . I believe that there be no perfect drama . but what make an excellent drama be its consistency and its heart . I believe that this drama have both . and even when people bash this because of the lack of chemistry ( I admit that there be a lack but not too much ) or the confusing fact ( but they explain it at the end well ) ,   I personally want to recommend it to other people . the effect be great , too . I also like how the camera capture the scene , especially the close - up one . I think they do a pretty good job in term of editing . a guy \\'s conclusion 101 : I do n\\'t want to forget . oblivion may be a grace , but forget goblin , her bride , grim reaper , sunny , goddess of birth , deok hwa and everyone of they would bring I more pain . this have honestly become my favorite drama ( out of almost 200) ... ever . you be probably think that I be exaggerate , but I can assure you there be no doubt that this be an amazing drama that be give I tear , lot of they , both happy and sad . the story be ambitious , let I tell you . the fantasy genre be not for the weak . many try , but there be few survivor . they tend to fall short , leave the audience wonder , and the plot become shaky . Goblin , though march right up to the top ( easily ) and stick it be flag in , claim its rightful place as the good fantasy drama make so far . it tell a story that span 900 year , rely heavily on draw parallel between past and present , but coherently weave all the little detail into place . everything make sense , and leave the audience in suspense through the entire show with it be twist and turn . the fantasy aspect be absolutely amazing as it be use both comically and as important element for the plot . it be never use just to show off the effect they can do . the show form such an amazing atmosphere as if you be in another world , and as an artist , I can assure you that this be the most aesthetically appealing show I have ever see . the acting be of course , top notch , with this star stud cast . by star stud , I do n\\'t mean idol ; these be talented and renowned actor that have prove their excellent acting ability with their previous work . fun fact , Lee Dong Wook , who normally have lead role , beg and beg the writer to cast he as the second lead . that be how good this script be , and you bet he work his butt off for this drama . Gong Yoo , I be sure you \\'ve see in plenty of other movie , namely train to Busan , never overact , but convey so much emotion and be just perfect for his role . there have be people talk badly about the lead actress , say she be n\\'t pretty enough , but I think she be absolutely gorgeous and have such a pure smile . she fit her role so well and you ca n\\'t help but love she . since the drama do everything else so well , I guess you ca n\\'t expect its OST to be perfect as well right ? but it be . many of the track have get million of view on Youtube and I have the entire OST replay on my phone . all of the music be just so atmospheric and fit for the show . I mean it when I say I love every single song , and that be pretty rare . I mean when be the last time you love every song on an album?alright well , I guess I be do singe praise for this drama . I ca n\\'t find a single thing to criticize , not because I be biased , but because it be just that good . by now you may have guess , but I wholeheartedly urge you to try this . you \\'ll find yourself roll around with laughter , pain , and feel so if you do n\\'t try it I may have to personally go over there , sit you down , and force you to watch it . now I be off to cure this post Goblin hangover and maybe cry in a corner . shoot I a pm if you need I ( especially for fangirle or cry purpose I be here for you)!I ca n’t elaborate enough on how good and brilliant this drama be . the story be original and keep the viewer hook . the character ! ! ! there be none I find annoying or intolerable . I love the character and the bond and relationship they ’ve have with each other . there be moment I ’d be laugh out loud and then there be moment where I have tear come out of my eye . the soundtrack be too darn good . brilliant drama . brilliant cast and acting . this one be definitely become one of my favourite . I never think that there would be another drama that could compare to the Healer or heal I , kill Mebut oh my GOD here it be .. the Goblin be freak awesome .. if you have not watch it yet I would suggest that you do asap . the cast be flip amazing .   so much chemistry .. the story line be amazing .. I love it from the beginning to the end .. I laugh when they do . I cry when they do . I want to say so much more but it would be consider spoiler .. the sound track be amazing .. would I watch it again .   yes , several time over .. story 10+Acting / Cast 10+Music 10+Rewatch value 10+overall 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ..... after DOTS , Goblin finally take the title of most popular drama . and it be true that everyone talk about this drama . in my opinion , that because of two thing : the OST and the cinematography . the soundtrack be really good and the song as atmospheric as they should be , create the right mood for every scene . then , the cinematography be amazing , with the first episode introduce breathtaking shot of battle and palace . the great cinematography continue on to the rest of the episode as well , aid when the drama hit standstill . in addition the theme be very original , as the plot be n\\'t clearly introduce to the audience , make you curious to want to see what be the buzz about this drama . well , the story be very fairy tale like , a man be turn into a goblin and he be wait for century to find the girl who will be destine to be his \" bride \" , which will also mean that she will be able to pull the sword out of his body and kill he . meanwhile , a grim ripper move into his house and he fall in love with a human . and here be where it become complicated , as the concept of reincarnation and four life be introduce . fortunately , they be clearly explain , so one ca n\\'t easily be confuse . now , about the negative : -the duration be way too long and that lead to countless flashback to be throw into each episode to make it long . -the romance be a little blunt . the performance be great , and the second romantic story be really good , with the chemistry between the couple obvious . maybe it be the age difference of the main couple ( the girl be still in school ) or the fact that the girl do n\\'t actually treat the idea of be the goblin bride seriously ; more like she use it as mean to survive . it get well towards the end , fortunately , but till then it be awkward . -the main story could have be well present -the ending be weak -the advertisement be too many ! ! other than that , it be an enjoyable drama ( still too long though ! ) and the side story be the good of it . so , 5 out of 10.i think , like many other so it seem , that this drama be way overrated ! I usually do n\\'t drop drama unless I really feel I be waste my time or fall asleep . well , in the end I manage to watch till episode 14 or be it 15 . the show do n\\'t make I even curious about the ending so I do n\\'t feel I be miss out on something by not watch anymore . for I , Goblin do n\\'t succeed in live up to the expectation it create in the first episode . Pro \\'s : beautiful scenery , beautiful house , first episode be interestingCon \\'s : romance be borderline pedophilia ( 19 year old high school girl with a 900 year old 40 look man ! whoever ship this ... think again ;) ) , extend run time for each episode make every episode drag on and on , lose steam after the first 3/4 episodesI\\'d say a 6.5 maybe 7 ( perhaps if I ever watch that last episode : d)i think that the cinematography and quality be amazing , but I think that there be many unnecessary scene and the drama be drag out long than necessary , sometimes do n\\'t make sense and there be some lazy cut . the acting be slightly awkward , even though the actor alone be act genius . I also feel that it be very , very unnecessarily cliche . but overall , it be a cute drama that I enjoyed.tl;dr : this drama be literally perfect . watch it . it be what all the cool kid be do . I do n\\'t like to give drama a 10 in every category , because there be ( almost ) always something a show can improve on . Goblin , though , get a 10 for everything because it do literally everything perfectly . I finish it just the other day , and think back , there be no issue I have with it . it have officially steal the top spot on my list of favorite drama . it be so amazing , and I love it to piece . seriously , just ... watch it . you wo n\\'t regret it even a little . no drama have ever make I both laugh and cry as consistently as this one . the story of this show be so creative . the character be so real , despite the show have such an fantastical plot . everything about the show be beautiful , with brilliant color and the good special effect I \\'ve ever see in a drama . all the actor do an amazing job . I usually do n\\'t like the female actress in drama , because they so often do n\\'t express much emotion . Kim Go Eun bring she all , though . I really do n\\'t like the character to begin with , but Ji Eun Tak grow so much over the course of the show , and go Eun portray the change excellently . another surprising thing be how kind , and caring , and real Kim Shin ( the Goblin ) be . he be such a sweet person , despite his struggle with having live so long . Gong Yoo darn near kill I with his portrayal of the Goblin . everything feel so genuine . Gong Yoo live his role , rather than just play they , and this have show throughout all of his work . Lee Dong Wook make a grim reaper seem cute . there be no one who could have play the role of the Grim Reaper well . Dong Wook do so well as the awkward , emotional grim reaper . the music be perfect for this show . it be so enchanting and relax . I would definitely be willing to watch this show again . I recommend this show , for sure . please , watch it . it be so perfect . I \\'ll never forget it . summary : if you have n\\'t already , watch this drama . can we just take a moment to acknowledge Kim Eun - sook \\'s wonderful storytelling . and a stand o for the cast and all the production crew for their hard work!+/- plot : hardly have I ever encounter a drama that have require I to think outside of the box when look for the plot twist and try to theorize about the backstory and characteristic of a character . the story as a whole be unexpectedly thrilling and as the week continue through , more question erupt -- but never in a way that leave I utterly confused and unsatisfied . I love how we slowly come to fully understand how the character be previously connect and such . I will say however , that midway through I slightly lose some interest as there be n\\'t much romance development . but it be understandably adorable as I assume they want to play up the innocence factor , it be a \" first love \" and all . the only reason I give the storyline a 9.5 be because there be no option for a 9.8 and I want to give a more honest rating . I be not in love with the ending of the show , to be perfectly honest I would have be over the moon with episode 15 be the final episode . I just feel that the final episode be a little ? ? , although look back on it I realize that it be kind of a nice touch for the final character development of Ji Eun - Tak.+/- Acting / cast : I feel as though the cast as a whole have such great chemistry , everyone just seem to mesh together so well and all seem so at ease and comfortable in their character . it be something that be pretty uncommon I \\'d say . it be heartwarming to see the fun time that the cast share behind the scene and how they be so at ease especially throughout their ad - libbe section . the sizzle between Kim Go - Eun and Gong Yoo be undeniable ! it be like a needle in a haystack when you find kiss this good in the copious amount of drama produce . I be happy to say that it be get well though ! but back to the actor , Kim Go - Eun really sparkle in this roll . she have the perfect amount of innocence as the school girl and maturity as the character grow up . and I \\'ll try to contain my fangirling , but we all know that Gong Yoo have steal every girl and woman \\'s heart . he be both wonderfully intense as the Goryeo Man and soooo adorable in his first love . my goodness , that bromance though . it be sweet to see how we see the brotherhood grow deeply as they grow more fond of one another . not only be the chemistry and witty banter between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook amazing , but the extra comical effect of Yook Sungjae make everything perfection . I really hope to see they work together in the future ! ( if you have n\\'t see Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook \\'s amazing spoof of the cover artwork , you definitely should -- so cute!)And a special shout out to the beautiful Yoo In - ha , so much beauty , charisma , and sass pack into her character . she be even more comical than I expect and it totally work ... also unexpected.+/- Music : all of the music be perfectly interweave with the filmography ! I could n\\'t believe my eye and ear when Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook came strut down the dark road , it be just pure matrimony . I be a huge fan of the soundtrack and have be listen to it on repeat for at least 2 - 3 day straight . my favorite song from the album change from day to day , so that tell you that all of it be simply amazing . I really want to love Goblin but I just couldn`t .   it have a great intro and the cinematography be amazing , it have great actor and the chemistry between the male actor be absolutely flawless and also half the reason I bother finish this drama . but for a drama to be good the story have to be somewhat good too . the writing could have be so much well , it`s a story about grim reaper , ghost , goblin , and god who live unnoticed by normal human . many of the side story be good , but it seem like the writer put so little effort into the main story compare to the side story and how much effort it be put into the cinematography .   I think the romance between the main couple be good , it didn`t care about the age difference it`s just that it be boring to watch compare to the secondary couple . conclusion ; I think this drama be overrate and could`ve be so much well it have great actor , cinematography , and music but the story just drag the drama so much down . it`s not a terrible drama I have watch a lot bad but it` not a great drama either . the two big complaint I ’ve read about this drama be regard the age difference and lack of external conflict .   normally , I ’d be right up in the stand blow raspberry with those people , but not this time .   I watch the one episode that have be English sub on YouTube and it hit all the pleasure center in my brain . be new to the Kdrama world I could n’t find it on - line and end up buy it on Amazon . I do n’t regret one penny spend on it . StoryI do n’t have a problem with the age difference .   the ML be 939 year old . anyone under 800 would n’t have anything in common with he .   but seriously , the ML and FL have be touch and in their eye curse by the supernatural , so these be not two ordinary people .   most importantly , she be the Goblin ’s bride , not wife .   she have one job and I wo n’t spoil it here but it be not to warm his bed .   he never come across as some old geezer try to seduce she .   even by Kdrama standard , this one be chaste . the Goblin know what her job be , anticipate and accept it .   but the moment she bring hope and light into his life the conflict within he and the story explode .   as he watch she and feel his heart begin to beat again the poetry that spring forth from he be so beautiful it give my brain a little orgasm . the conflict in this story be mostly internal but the stake be high . I usually skim the secondary character \\' story   because too often they seem like filler and distract from the main storyline . not this time .    the Reaper ’s and sunny ’s story be seamlessly interweave and integral to the main story . the bromance between the Goblin and Reaper be legendary so I wo n’t go into it . I watch every minute of this drama , savor each one . forgiveness play a big role in this story . our character find it be not easily earn or give , whether it be for the self , other , or the Powers that be . ActingThis be my first time for all these actor and I would n’t make a single casting change . Gong Yoo do an amazing job as ruthless warrior , tragic guardian angel and Oscar to the Reaper ’s Felix . Kim Go Eun do a good job as the girl both afflict and bless by her special case . the secondary character be all spot on and Lee Dong Wook have to be one of the most beautiful crier in the business . OSTI do n’t normally pay attention to the music unless I love it or despise it . the music in Goblin enhance the story without distract from it , a difficult task .   I thoroughly enjoy it . the cinematography be stunning . I have to shush my photographer husband who keep comment on it . which bring I to the rewatch value . rewatch ValueMy husband who have only watch a few scatter episode of asian drama sit down and watch this with I on my second go around . we laugh and cry together ( damn allergy ! ) .   I will watch it again . and again . this story of love , family , friendship , redemption , and forgiveness be definitely worth a try . overall , this drama be fun to watch .   the show explore interesting theme about life , death , and the possible realm that exist in between .   you get to see some beautiful cinematic footage , and most of the acting be on point , especially with Lee Dong Wook play a grim reaper .   he deserve a lot of credit for make his character the most complex and interesting one in the show .    plus , do he not give Puss - in - boot a run for his money in term of be able to seduce the audience with such big , sad eye ?   it be quite an art to be able to fill up your eye like that with such sorrowful tear so often and so masterfully . unfortunately , there be a lot of inconsistency and unexplained phenomenon in the story line , especially toward the end .   I be disappoint with the last few episode ; they feel rush and slap together last minute .    in fact , I think that be what really happen , consider the delay in production .   the creator have opportunity to tie together the theme they touch upon and get creative with it , but they completely miss those chance .   and talk about overdo it with the product placement!All that be say , I still love it , if not mostly for the awesome and unbearably cute bromance between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook .   they have great chemistry together and their dynamic be way more interesting than the actual boy - girl romance , in my opinion .   they be two of my favorite actor , so there you go , I be totally biased !    with this bias in mind , I give it a generous 8 out of 10.i\\'m secretly kind of glad it be a letdown at the end , because otherwise I \\'d be feel those post - drama blues!I want to leave a review while the show be still fresh in my mind . I just want to say exactly what I feel . this show be downright one of the most beautiful thing you \\'ll ever see . from the casting , to the cinematography , to the writing , everything be sheer perfection . it be kind of epic . you can feel the beautiful way the creator see the world , with its particular touch of darkness . it will hurt you , and make you laugh , even in the midst of your pain , like the grim Reaper in that one scene , you \\'ll not have a choice . rate the show the high possible rating be n’t even up for debate . the thing about a good story be that you can have a massive budget and top rate actor but if you have a stale , unworthy story and half boil character , it just do n\\'t work . the value of this show be that every character be so deep , so believable , so real , you ca n\\'t help getting lose in they . few minor gripe I have be that Duek Hwa and Jung Hae In should have have well storyline . second , toward the end the amnesia bit drag a bit for I . ( minor spoiler ) even the whole find love in past life instead of present be again a bit typical for a show of this caliber . what you can do in a next life you can do in this one , for this reason the last two or three episode in place it get a bit boring for I . still , I be happy to have see this show , I \\'ve never quite see anything like it . all in all , bravo!This drama be really something special and after watch it I feel kind of lost to find something similar amazing . the story be kind of clear from the start but the cast make it very interesting and very very very emotional . every character have it be own habit and weirdness but that make they even more loveable . at first I have my trouble with the female lead Kim Go Eun because sometimes it seem as if she be try to hard and it make I cringe but maybe that be because we meet she in different stage of her life , as a highschool senior and a college student and at her later work . so it be kind of understandable that she go through some change in life and in her personality and that make I really like she later on . the relationship between the Goblin and his bride develop with some up and down and even more interesting be the relationship between the Grim Reaper and sunny - so heartbreaking ! I love the fact that the Grim Reaper probably go through the big and hard change during the series as he start off as an emotionless weirdo . I love the music ! I even add it on my playlist and I be listen to the intro song all the time!I would rewatch it but this drama make I so emotional ! ! I think that I be cry all the time through the last 3 episode ... that be almost like 5 hour of crying . it have kind of an ending I could be happy with but before I could be happy it have to punch I in the face and heart and everything come so suddenly ... so I will wait until I have the nerve to watch it again . overall - I love IT!I give it a begrudging overall 9/10 .I just want to start of by say that Goblin be a really sad drama . I just want to put that out there because all the top comment and review out   there on the World wide web rave on in a fan girl manner that you would think it ’ boy over flower . I be mislead and the sadness genuinely catch I off guard . it ’ SAD.Now that ’ out of the way - let I address why I give it a begrudging 9/10.goblin do not convince I at all that it be a perfect show .   it ’s age gap and high school lead be really uncomfortable for I to fathom .Why do they have to make she into a high school kid though ? and though Gong Yoo be hot and all ; he really look considerably old than his female lead and that be just uncomfortable . but that ’ an internal personal bias and have nothing to do with the plot unravel . creep factor aside - this be a really original story with an interesting and dare I say new premise . I admire how the writer stay true to their intention and you could tell they never fall off but keep focus . it have great quote too and I love the deity aspect of the show - it give it a divine elegance . however - this be a tricky review to write because as a romantic drama - it tick all the right box . great sweeping love declaration scene ? yes . in fact they be touch . Angst ? yes - sure to cry like a baby . great support lead with equally engage angsty story line ? yes , yes and yes . great romantic kissing scene ? yes . but nooo . it ’ not a 10 . the plot be not tight enough . it be repetitive use the same set up over and over again that it actually waste time in set up other important relationship such as the support lead relationship progression and the reincarnate relationship that be discover along the line . kudo though to the plot twist which be very much appreciated . sure to keep a viewer tune in . it also have time in its 16 episode with rich story to insert a villain which I think be deft . I also like the way they handle the past inform the present and the notion of reincarnation and it ’s support motif . the romance be also lovely . emotional resonance be very strong too . I cry like a baby in Ep 13 which be one of the good moment in tv history . the last episode be so poignantly sad too . Comedy be also very well do .The act and cast be unblemished . Gong Yoo be so funny and melancholy at the same time . the Grim Reaper be gorgeous and grim at the same time and the female lead be assertive , spunky yet passionate in the same this showthe soundtrack be quite possibly one of the good of the good and do much to bolster the rating . I love every song and my standout be beautiful Life , Hush ( Goblin lullaby , the second lead song I miss you , I will go to you like the First Snow , oh my word - I ’m list the whole sound track ! that ’ how good it be ! the fashion be off the chart ! Deok Hwa ’s coat and suit , Grim Reaper ’s cozy oversized sweater and Goblin ’s coat be amazing ! sunny ’s outfit be worthy of a Pinterest board alone . rewatch value be quite strong once I get over the creep factor . soul be apparently immortal and ageless right ? so we will stick with that and suck it up ... as for the OVERALL - do n’t waste anymore time and go ahead and watch it ! if there ’ anything this show convince   I of other than a sad love of a lonely and great god be that it ’ definitely one of those show you need to have under your belt for posterity reason . also , if you love my love from the Star , you will surely find this pleasant too . if you like some supernatural and super sadness then this one be for you .can\\'t even put in word how much this series have affect I . it be a Masterpiece . the Ost , the editing , the storyline , the chemistry , the acting every single thing be just awesome ! ! every character have it own story and the actor do a marvelous job to inact it . the continuous bashful comment by the Goblin and the grim reaper be savage . it never miss an opportunity to make you laugh till the very end and I be laugh my ass off throughout . not only comedy , it be full of romance and drama . the line be beautiful and everything connect so well ( thing say in past connect later to a thing happen in present ) just wow ❤ ️A moment I feel goosebump and in another I be cry ( literally a lot ) and in next I be laugh like anything , its that level . I recommend this to everyone who love Kdrama ( even if you do n\\'t you \\'ll after watch this?)A classic of all time ❤ ️Upon re - watch a show , or watch it critically the first time , much can be say about where the director fail , where the author confuse , where the actor falter . there be work of art , however , that do not lend themselves to such criticism . Goblin be one such show . it be not perfect . the fault I mention ( and those that have be and will be mention by other ) be present in Goblin . yet Goblin be n\\'t the sort of artwork to reveal these fault to the engage viewer . again , much will be say in the way of critique and analysis , as it should be . but if you come across this show and ever find yourself immerse — hopefully in the first episode — Goblin will refuse to release you until its final moment . it do what every artist hope their work will do : it submerge you in the world it construct and , when it end , leave a part of its world with you . GOBLIN be by far one of most amazing k - series I have ever watch ! the plot be well write , the character be amazing and although it be a fantasy story , the special effect be just in right amount , not one be use randomly or without logic . plot twist , romance , humor , drama ... it have everything in perfect balance . I highly recommend it for everyone and anyone willing to witness a great story!I have watch it because I find the plot interesting , I be not a fan of GY or KGE . at the first episode I find her irritating but then I get use to she . the story be interesting and keep you wonder about what be gon na happen next . I will probably watch another drama of GY but I do not think that I \\'ll watch one of KGE drama .   I have watch Train to Busan and he be very talented.while watch there be one thing might irritate you that be the great age difference betw Goblin & ET.That love thing in the edge of be a pedapholieGoblin be a man who be over 900 yrs old but look like a man who be in his late 30 \\'s early 40 \\'s while ET be only 19 yr old and a high schooler . she be inlove with a man who be   at the age of her dad / can be easily have / have kid at her age . and if we think of the era he come from he possibly might have concubine , wife and a couple of kid . they be good match physically but in this drama , it be over the border .   I do ship they but not on this drama , they can easily be bf / gf as KGE like elderly guy and GY like young girl . I be more interested in sunny and grim Reaper couple .    they be a fantastic couple . there be a lot of product placement , from stuff toy , to TBS White Musk Perfume , which I end up buy and now use a room spray as the perfume be that much crap , the watch he wear , canon camera which be worth over £ 2000 this be with only a small lens . I only find the Canon placement irritate I think it be relate with the upcoming scene as they have openly show we , like poke someone \\'s eye .   it be that obvious . I really enjoy the Canada scene , and a couple of Korea   Seoul scene but that be it . I want to see Yoo in Na , LDW , Yook Sung Jae , & Lee El in one drama .    I will not go back & rewatch this drama .   it be one shot for I , I will forget about it within few month . if it be not KGE as a lead lady , and if there be less flashback , less repetition it would be an excellent dramaGoblin have a lot to offer . it handle one of the deep concept ; death , life , destiny , choice and regret . and it do a great job with it . it be a very realistic drama , while have fantasy elements(with great special effect ) which make it x100 time well . it have great life story . and what I mean by life be that it have friendship , family , and great love . it talk about be a human , it talk about learn to love yourself and other . it be funny , it be sad , it be beautiful and every moment of it shine . it be just one the good story I have ever see and I wish everyone would get to see this . okay , I \\'ll start by let you know that among all the drama I \\'ve watch , even though I have favorite , I never feel the need to post a review . so this be my first time . Goblin be just amazing , that I feel like I be commit a grave mistake by not review it and let everyone know how amazing it really be . furthermore , this be also my very first time rate a drama a whole 10 . not because they be n\\'t amazing , nor be it because I feel like they do n\\'t deserve it , just purely because I feel like no drama can ever get a whole 10 . it feel impossible to I . however , as you guy can clearly see , I give Goblin a 10 . this speak volume of this drama . even my drama hate hubby , decide to give this one a shot after glimpse a scene of it while I be watch one of the early episode . story : the story line be spectacular , the idea in itself be original . I \\'ve never watch anything remotely close to Goblin \\'s story line . the way everything be time and space be perfect , I never feel like there be a moment of boredom . the plot , the poem , the scene , the cinematography , my god , the cinematography be pure bliss . it really show the amount of work and thinking that go into this production . even the ending , - I wo n\\'t go into detail with that , as not to spoil it for the people who have n\\'t watch it yet - this be one of the very few drama that wrap up the ending very well . even though it be bittersweet , it just feel right and make total sense . there be n\\'t anything that be over the top or throw in together just to satisfy the audience even though it make no sense whatsoever . there be romance , Comedy and Suspense weave in together perfectly . cheer to the writer and producer . act / cast : I \\'ve read a few comment here and there while the drama be still air . some people find the relationship between the Goblin and Eun Tak disturbing because of the large age gap ( 939 year ) , but if you think about it , it would n\\'t have make sense for they to just meet for the first time when she be old . he be be live for the past 900 year , so his bride be bind to be bear sometime throughout his lifetime and she be bind to be much young than he . also , the production team limit the relationship between the Goblin and the young Eun Tak to cutesy and adorable moment . there be nothing immoral about it . so if anyone be hesitate to watch this drama because of this issue then fear not . I feel like the cast do an amazing job . each actor and actress portray their character in a way that make I laugh and cry with they . I feel each person \\'s sorrow and pain . even the chemistry between they be amazing . the Bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper be mind blow . I feel like if it be n\\'t for this specific cast , the story line would n\\'t have be portray as seamlessly as it have be . so , cheer to the cast as well . music : the OST be superb . you wo n\\'t be able to prevent yourself from repeatedly play the song on a loop . whenever I be wait for the next episode to air , I would just play the OST and reminisce on the previous scene . I miss everything about this drama already ! everything ! ? ? ? ? ? :\\') this drama now hold a special place in my heart ! it may even be my new # 1 fav drama , especially since it be in the supernatural / fantasy / romance genre , which be my fav ! the drama give I great feeling , especially from the character ( and I must say that this drama have the best freaking bromance ever ! ! ! ) . I \\'d watch BTS of Goblin with Lee Dong Wook and Gong Yoo and they be just an amazing pair . add Sung Jae to the mix make it even well . Hahahaha xD the 3 be a riot ! ? ? ? I laugh and I be happy . I cry and I feel pain . there be never a dull moment watch this drama , each episode well than the previous . I never skip an episode , nor do I fast forward anything . everything about this drama be absolutely stunning . ? the plot ( which be somewhat heartbreaking yet beautiful ) , the character and their personality , to the amazing cinematography(which look like it take you to a whole new world ) , even down the the music ( OST ) . ? I love the main character so much . my ship ? ? ~ it be funny cos at one point , I ship the Goblin and the Reaper ! Hahahaha xD those two kill me!Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak be so adorable and smart . I love how enthusiastic her character be . she be be thru so much and she be still able to smile and be optimistically cheerful and always help people even when she be go thru stuff . she have such a kind soul . Yoo in Na as sunny be awesome . she be sassy , beautiful and radiant , like the Sun ! ^^ Yook Sung Jae as Yoo Deok Hwa make the whole bromance well . Hahahaha xD I love how they \\'d tease he sometimes and he \\'d get mad and frustrated . Hahahaha xD his character be a blessing to the drama , not gon na lie . I love how all their life be intertwine with each other and the twist that come with it all . there be certain thing that would happen that you would not expect and you be just like , @#$% ! LolI love the beautiful , breathtaking , heartwarming , heartbreaking , sizzling hot chemistry between the couple . Most complain about the age difference . who give af ? they be all adult so it do n\\'t matter . I do n\\'t think about that when I be watch the drama . the chemistry be there and it be just perfect ! ? ? ? ? I be enjoy it too much to care . lol ~ the soundtrack be just wonderful to listen to and very catchy . I do n\\'t know how they do it but it be just amazing . OMG ! some of the song give I feel and not just because of the scene they \\'d play it with , but if you actually listen to some of the song , it resonate something within you . ? ? ? I wait for this drama patiently and with high hope and I be not disappoint one bit . my expectation be exceed . ? ? ? ? ? be there any flaw ? cos if there be I ca n\\'t think of a single thing at least to I there be n\\'t any . a perfect 10/10 ! I commend the writer for do such an excellent job with this drama!The rewatch value be extremely high for I , because good believe I will download every single episode and rewatch it again and I will definitely download the entire soundtrack and listen to it on repeat . Goblin be a must watch~ you will not regret it ! :\\') ? if you do decide to give this drama a shot , I truly hope you enjoy watch ! ^^this may come as a surprise but when Globin start air , I have no interest in watch it . let ’s say I love Asian Culture and entertainment , that be why I watch drama but one thing be true , Asians be not good in do description and to I Goblin sound lame , over de top fantasy / comedy . I can say for sure that none of those word above can be use to describe it in the end . there have be a long time since a drama move I in such a way like this one . it be a touching and sincere love story and have the one thing I love the most about romance , it be drama , movie or book . Goblin have \" great love \" . for the one who do n’t know , \" great love \"   be that genuine love that the person be capable of sacrifice everything for the other one , without selfishness or jealousy or greed . it be just pure love and it be great . many love story try this line but few achieve it , Goblin do . if you be read this , you probable already read de description on the top of the page , it be terrible so let I tell you . this drama be the story of a goblin , a darned creature , who be crush to walk on earth forever and see all his love one die . the only person capable of end this curse , so he can go to ashe , be his bride . so he go on wait   for the bride to appear . that ’ all you need to know . it be beautifully make , the tempo of all drama be well do , none of it get boring , in the end of each episode you will die want more . for the drama veteran , it do n’t have almost any clichés of korean drama , no second league guy , no annoying girl , no mother in low or and to I it fell new and refreshing . it have one thing that be cliché but this one be to you to find out . and the acting , I can say that Goblin revive a lot of carrier and impulse new one , for sure . Gong Yoo as Kim Shin be a gift to I , it have be such a long time I watch and love a drama with he . I love Coffee Prince , and I love he on Coffee Prince . so to I watch he do so good as the Goblin make I really pound . Kim Go Eum be a nice surprise , I watch some episode of cheese in a trap , but I do n’t finish it   so I could n’t tell mush of her background , in Goblin she be refreshing and funny and a strong female lead , you can relate to she and both of they together be explosive .In the beginning I think the age difference between the character would make it a little weird , not because the Goblin have more than 900 year , but Gong Yoo be in this late 30 ’s and Ji Eum Tak be in high school . she even call he \" ajushi \" , but you buy it and you buy their love , by the way , she be over eighteen . for the second role , Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper be other act as be really happy to see revive , he be not long go like Gong Yoo but the last few year I be happy watch he in Roommate than in a drama , and it be sad . but he do so well in Goblin that I hope the next drama he do be the same incredible . Yoo in Na , sunny , do also an amazing job , I do n’t know if I ’m be mean but seem like in Na have a face of a mean lead but do so much well as second one , not say she be not talente but she do so well in this character that I want to see she do it again . one very important point I have to talk about be the grim Reaper and sunny story line . technically be the second story line but it be so well treat here that it feel like main one . the two story line need each other to be excellent and neither of they feel less because of it . it be something really hard to do in story telling . so applause to the Globin team for archive it . about the sound track , \" never far away \" be my favorite music high now . I listen to it 5 or 6 time a day . so it be enough to say I love it and if someone say it be not good , they be crazy . the rest of the song too , be amazing . and about the end , it be something very important to I in a drama . it can break or make the drama for I . there be so many drama that go down on rank to I because of bad ending , I be afraid this one would too . it do n’t . the end be not fairytale , it be not necessary happy … it be beater sweet I would say , but it be as much of beautifully make as the rest of the drama . and now if I think about it , for the entire drama there be clue of the end , you just do n’t realize it . so , you may be wonder why my score be 9,5 and not a 10 if I like it so much . well , even if it be an amazing drama , there be some question and inexplicable aspect that this drama do n’t answer . thing that I find out in the internet but it be the drama that have to give I it , but how it be nothing major I just take 0,5 a point . overall Goblin be a jewel , worth of watch at least one time or three or four . I ’m for sure come back and watch it again . first of all , I think one of the most important thing for a drama be the pacing . how many time have you watch a drama and it be only when you finish the 3rd or 4th episode that it be start to get good ? in Goblin in episode 1 you be introduce to all main character without an \" in your face \" introduction . the world building be enough for understand the story , but keep just enough mystery and detail to catch the attention . the music be amazing and , from I remember , well time between scene . in some drama you feel like by episode 2 you hear they all already , in this one it take more and the ambience be fitting ( plus I think they be very good , even though it be not really my type ) . the casting be phenomenal and every character have a story that be relevent and interesting . the second role be not just a distraction from the main cast \\'s story . I could talk about Goblin all day , but finally , the plot and ending , you do nt see it comme and it be more and more rare these day I think , that be all I be gon na say . I\\'m a grown man in my twenty and I cry many time and that be what I want from drama , to reach my emotion . whether it be from sadness , hapinne or both be for you to find out . I have to admit by the end I be emotionally invest to the point of cry over the secondary couple . but just because I enjoy it at some point or I cry do n\\'t mean I ca n\\'t be critical of it . first thing first , the female lead be such a generic female character in a romantic film / show . we \\'ve see she a hundred time over , please get rid of this overused rom com dynamic . her selfishness and her absolute self importance make I continuously piss off during the entire show . second . let we never overlook the age gap . from the second the 2 lead meet I automatically assume we would watch she grow up and have the romance at a more reasonable age . but that do n\\'t happen . we get a very creepy romance between a man in his 40 \\'s ( 900 \\'s ) and a 19 year old girl . her absolute infatuation with he be impossible to get past . how she beg to marry he and demand love from such an old man make my gut twist . truly the show would have be well with the secondary couple as the main . sunny and grim Reaper be a more believable pair and ultimately a more tragic story . sunny be a much well female character . more interesting and overall keep I watch to see it to the end . the bromance be funny at time and as separate moment they be good but in the context of the scene they seem really random and misplace . overall very melodramatic and inconsistent . inconsistent writing , character and pacing . it definitely be n\\'t terrible and certain moment have I go back to rewatch because there be really good individual moment but in the end it seem to be a very cheesy and overhyped due to the handsome actor . but that be just my opinionthis drama be one of the good out there for story , acting , music , and production value . if you have n\\'t watch it yet you should ! the acting be absolutely amazing . all of the character have chemistry and you could tell they enjoy what they be do . the bromance between the Goblin and the Reaper even become famous , but this time it actually seem like the actor truly become friend . the story be great , it pull at your heartstring . I laugh , and cry , and be scared ( there be some spooky part and I be watch this alone in the dark at night , so do n\\'t judge I -_- ) . the ending be sad , yet wonderful . the especial effect be actually really good . the music be great . all in all a well make drama , and I highly recommend it . Goblin be the first k - drama I see . until that moment I have just only watch japanese drama , but at the time I already know Gong Yoo for \" train a Busan \" and I have hear so much about the \\xa0 show that I give it a try . after this , I watch lot of k - dramas , so I guess this show be to blame that now I be a k - drama addict . and even have watch so many of they , anything could be compare to Goblin . without any doubt it be the good drama I \\'ve ever see in my entire life . everything be wonderful . the story ( from a non - used to k - drama point of view ) be kind of unusual . the photography , the setting ( oh , Quebec , one of the most wonderful place I \\'ve ever be ) , the dialogue , the humor , the bromance , the romance ... I love Gong Yoo in every one of \\xa0 the thing he have do , but here he be amazing as the lonely tokebi . for the rest of the casting , they be all perfect , overall Lee Dong Wook as the Grim reaper ( his bromance with the Goblin be mythic , so funny!)other thing that I really like in this show be that you do n\\'t have a love triangle , nor the trope so use in other drama , and you have the opportunity to see the evolution in both couple . the only thing I complain be that the main couple do not have much explanation time at the end \\xa0 as they should have . there be too \\xa0 much time to explain the Grim Reapers and sunny ( not Sun Hee ) future and not so much for the main couple ... dommage!this show taugh I so many thing I could continue for hour explain why everybody should watch it . I have read some bad review explain that it be so slow that be boring . I do n\\'t know but for I it be n\\'t slow at all . it have the right pace for a perfect development of the story and the character . music : love it . one of by k - drama ost.rewatch value : I \\'ve watch this show three time already and I watch it every now and then while I decide what to see next . so , last advise , don\\'t miss it , best drama ever!this drama hit I like a truck , I hear it be good but I be really not prepare . note to anyone who be even vaguely emotional : you will need tissue , you will probably cry . a lot . and hopefully laugh a lot too!the actor chemistry for this drama be perfection , they gel so well and the story intertwine with one another be amazingly well write . I be n\\'t as keen on   the grim Reaper at the start but I warm to he as the drama continue and he become a firm favourite , although in fairness , I love they all , apart from that Aunt and her kid , they can go away ! although a lot of it be serious and deal with a lot of difficult subject / theme , there be a lot of hilarious moment too and you get to witness bud friendship between an unlikely group of character which also result in some very funny section of the drama . the story be full of twist and turn which leave you at the edge of your seat , I for one be so glad that I do n\\'t watch this whilst it be air where I \\'d have to endure wait for the next episode week to week , it would have be torture!i\\'ve only watch 23 drama , give 2 include Goblin a 10 ( the other be \" it be ok , that be love \" because of the difficult topic it deal with incredibly well ) but honestly , I \\'d give Goblin a 100 + if I could , I \\'ve never laugh and cry so much for one drama . you will feel happiness , sadness , elation , loneliness , grief and heartache at various stage of this but it be worth   it thousand of time over . I \\'d rewatch this over and over again when I need a good dose of feel or just a laugh at a certain secretarie \\'s dance move and super serious bromance moment . the OST be beautiful and I have get it all save on my Spotify for when I need a Goblin moment ! it capture the mood of the drama so well , it be worth a listen away from the drama to fully appreciate it . i\\'ve see people complain about the age gap which I can kinda understand but at the same time , in this day an age there be an age gap in a relationship be n\\'t uncommon , she be 19/20 in this , I do n\\'t see it as be particularly \\' creepy \\' as her character be immensely mature and have a lot of depth . love be n\\'t confine to age . there have also be criticism of product placement but it do n\\'t bother I anywhere near as much as the obvious sticky tape over brand label that I see in man other drama . I be so used to product placement in tv show and movie that it do n\\'t really bother I , some of the placement be quite funny anyway . if anything , Goblin have do a great job at make I want to go back to visit Canada again ; 3i hold off from watch this for age as the plot sound a bit weird but I regret not watch it soon as I would have be able to re - watch it a few time by now so if you be hesitate , please just go and watch it and you will understand what all the fuss be about . i\\'m a complete goblin fangirl , I confess.the story be lovely , I cry right away in the first episode . when I start to watch , I just could not stop watch ! I shiver every time the opening begin , and even today when I hear this same song from the opening , my heart be fill with joy . I tell all people that goblin be a work of art , it be almost impossible to stop watch after you start.the actor be captivating , you learn to love they more and more throughout the episode and then you feel miss they when you finish watch all the episode . the friendship between the goblin and the reaper be really something from another world , I love it when character create sympathy throughout the episode and create a bond of strong friendship . in general , the relationship in this drama be well think out and everything be think out very well.the scenario and soundtrack of the drama really be good , I listen to the soundtrack every day , I feel so happy listen to these song . all the scenario and the palette of drama \\'s color be magnificent . all the people who work on this drama deserve the congratulation , it really look very beautiful and I will never forget this drama . and conclude : Goblin be first on my list of favorite , I be completely in love with this drama , I want to be able to re - watch this drama all my life lol . decide to watch goblin be one of the good drama choice I \\'ve hadGoblin be massively hype on multiple platform across the internet , but fail to meet my high expectation . \\xa0 it be a good series , no doubt , but somehow I just expect more out of it . even though the story could have be improve at the beginning a lot as I be very close about give up on Goblin , I be happy I manage to get through the first few episode as this series improve a lot when it be near the end . act of the cast be up to standard , however I find the age difference between Kim Shin ( Gong Yoo ) and Ji Eun Tak ( Kim Go Eun ) bothersome and somehow find the secondary love couple more interesting ; grim reaper ( Lee Dong Wook ) and sunny ( Yoo in Na ) . Goblin \\'s Music be top notch . enjoy it very much with these beautiful song out there . now you can disregard my rewatch value rank as I be absolutely not fan of rewatche series , cause the story be spoil once you know most of it already . I hold the opinion that Goblin be the good korean drama of the past decade , and perhaps of all time . the latter statement   be more bold , but this drama hold to your expectation and will fly past they . i\\'ve rewatche this drama a countless number of time without find substantial flaw , even if I be be nitpicky . you \\'ll love these character and their relationship ( be it romance , bromance , or friendship ) long past your first time watch it , and you \\'ll remember their most iconic quote , too . Goblin be a masterpiece with gorgeous cinematography , writing , and one of the good ost I \\'ve ever hear . not only that , but it be completely different from any other drama out there while be down to earth and heartwarming as well . the only reason I would not recommend this drama be if you have never watch a KDrama before- Goblin be so perfect that once you \\'ve see it , most any other drama will be lackluster thereafter . see how Goblin be consider to be one of the most popular k - dramas of all time , be the most popular drama on MDL , I have to watch it . I wonder why it be so popular since though it be good , it be n\\'t that good . there be plenty of k - drama that be much well than Goblin with mainstream appeal like Crash Landing on you . I think its popularity can be attribute to the age and social class difference between its ML and FL . a wealthy old man with a poor , young student . since its a bit taboo , the drama get controversy which get eyeball to this drama . it also help serve as wish fulfillment for   old man who lust after young woman and young woman who dream of an old man take care of they , akin to Lolita . anyhow , I think that this Kdrama be addicting and engage though I would n\\'t say that it grab I like Crash Landing on you . the story do n\\'t make much sense at time and there be moment that make I scratch my head , but it be an interesting melodrama that keep my attention nevertheless . that be until the last several episode , which be melodramatic , nonsensical and boring unfortunately . I do n\\'t care for the main couple ( Goblin and Ji Eun Tak ) to be honest . not because of the age / class difference but rather because their story be quite boring . I prefer the relationship of the second lead ( reaper and sunny ) , which be charming . whenever there be scene with the first lead , I would get restless and anxious for they to be over so that I could get Goblin and grim Reaper scene or grim Reaper and sunny scene . I love the bromance between Grim Reaper and Goblin ! to be honest , I ship they . I would have prefer that they get together instead . that would have make a well , far more interesting drama in my opinion . on a side note , it be impressive that Gong Yoo star in the one of the most popular k - drama , Goblin , and also one of the most popular korean film , train to Busan . full disclosure : I watch this drama because I need to see more of Lee Dong Wook and Yoo in Na in lead role after watch ( and love ! ) touch your heart . I be always hesitant to watch Goblin because I \\'ve hear just how heartbreaking it be . I come in fully prepare know that I would cry my eye out . and I do ... but not for the main couple . I cry for the bromance of Goblin and Reaper . I cry for the romance between Reaper and sunny . I even cry for the soul that Reaper lead to the afterlife ! but , I do not cry for Goblin and his bride and even skip some of their scene . the main reason for that be because I could not relate at all with the female lead . she act like such a child for most of the drama ... which be understandable since her character be a nineteen - year - old high - schooler!!My big gripe be that there be such a big difference in station between the male lead Kim Shin and the female lead Eun Tak . the ML be a powerful figure even in present - day ; he literally can use magic , own a mansion , have many people do his bidding , and be incredibly rich . he also look like he be in his mid-30s ( no shade against Gong Yoo , just state fact ) . meanwhile , the FL be a poor , penniless high - schooler . she be 19 for most of the drama . there be such an imbalance of power - in their experience , because he be so much old than she , and in their social status as well . it be very disconcerting to see a romantic relationship develop between they . on the flip side , the bromance between Goblin and Reaper be great . their interaction with each other be one of my favourite to see . the reveal later on in the drama break my heart . what outshine everything be Reaper and sunny \\'s relationship . you know from the moment they meet that they be doom in this lifetime . but the why be hide until later and the reveal , again , be heartbreaking . but they push through , they accept their fate ... and they have their happy ending . so , to summarize : story : it be ok . I do not care for the female lead and even the main plot of Goblin need his bride to pull the sword from his chest be overshadow later on by Reaper \\'s past . act / cast : everyone play their part well . as much as I dislike the female lead , Go Eun do a great job play a high schooler in my opinion . my favourite be Dong Wook . he have I laugh with his hilarious outburst and make I cry for his conversation with the soul and his expressive eye . music : they do n\\'t have a lot of variety . the same music be play over and over again for the dramatic scene . it be n\\'t my taste either . rewatch value : I would n\\'t watch this drama in full . can I just get a cut of the Reaper / sunny moment and the bromance ? lol . overall : an ok drama . if they have age up the female lead , or age down the male lead , then this drama would n\\'t feel so ... icky in some part . watch it for Reaper / sunny , and then watch touch your heart afterwards!after think about this overnight , and some more think it time to give my thought . story : AI\\'m not one for historical drama , but I feel this be a great start for I , in historical drama . it not really all historical but it a very intriguing part of Goblin .   the romance be really great in this , I have one flaw but ca n\\'t really go into it because of spoilersActing / cast : I be not go to be do the acting / cast the way I usually do a person in the cast but I be go to do the chemistry .   Gong Yoo , and Lee Dong Wook , be the first two I want to discuss . they have the perfect bromance in this that make I really love it between the two be really what make the show for I . the other one be Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun have great chemistry , and they have great chemistry with their romance be really well do .   honorable mention to the second lead chemistry . music : the song that stick out to m the most in this drama be stay with I . it fit the show so well , and it let I have somewhat I call , that it make I love the show more . the other song be ok , but they do not stick much ( which be say much because music be what I rate hard in dramas).rewatch / overall : overall this be a 10 for I , I love this show so much that it   worth a watch . the re watch value be also a 10 , I will rewatch this . there be some thing you need to know before give this drama a go - it be slow paced but not really - confuse right ? what I mean be that the loveline itself be progress rather normally , except that you do n\\'t have the typical love - rival that tend to get on your nerve or give you second - lead syndrome . its slowness come in the developing of the story , as the conflict appear pretty late . but , if you be to ask I , I kind of enjoy the way it be structure , it give I time to process everything and really immerse myself in the plot . also , I be quite surprised with the character . in spite of the hate that the main couple receive because of their 12 year difference , I kind of get where the writer be go . also I do n\\'t find the relationship between the 2 awkward , and I love the fact that Eun Tak act as her age and do n\\'t try to be more mature , despite of what she have go through in her life . I be a big fan of her character and her positive and brave personality , the fact that she do n\\'t hide her feeling for the Goblin be quite fresh and help in avoid not need drama to the series . in my case , I love the Grim Reaper the most . also his character be the most interesting one in whole bunch . Lee Dong Wook be such a talented actor , especially when it come to emotional scene , he have one of the good crying face in the industry . I love the complex story that surround his character and how he come in term with it . Goblin be really a beautiful drama . it deal with reincarnation , a theme that be not really use , and if it be , usually be some kind of subplot . it be interesting to see how soul can recognize each other , and how there story can tangle up again and again . it will make you curious of your own world , our world , and make you think of moment that maybe you feel and instant connection with someone . it may be fantasy but who really know , reality be that we ourselves do n\\'t know the mystery that be attach to life and death or what be beyond it . I recommend you to watch this drama with an open heart , ready to be surprised and question it . truth be we all like some miracle in our life , and this drama be good in that aspect , it be full of miracle and topic that be n\\'t discuss before . so enjoy the ride and let it make you fall in love with it and its characters!goblin be an ambitious drama - a high production value drama with gorgeous cinematography - and TvN pull it off well . grant , the ~90 minute episode be a bit hard to adjust to and the drama do linger on some moment . nevertheless , I never think the drama be overhype . the combination of the breathtaking way scene be film , and the wealth of heart Goblin possess be enough to pull I in . I do n\\'t usually talk about editing but I have to say that Goblin \\'s editing and stylistic filming be one of my favorite out of all drama . I love the historic backstory , sometimes even more than the present . the historic story be the anchor of the emotional resonance of the present timeline . Goblin \\'s world of fantasy be fun , weave well , and interesting . the rule be n\\'t always the most clear but I can accept that . the core of the story lie in the action and consequence of the Goblin , and the life he touch . of course , the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper be my favorite relationship by far . the dry insult they pass back and forth amongst themselves be the good because under the insult lie affection , as much as they hate to admit it . the romance in Goblin be n\\'t the most important to I until the second half of the drama , when the stake be raise higher and the emotion feel heavy . admittedly , I do n\\'t love the romance between the Kim Shin and Eun Tak in the beginning because their relationship seem to be more of a lost soul to lose soul connection , and not a romantic one . it be n\\'t until later do I finally feel their subtle chemistry , then I fall head in for they in the second half . disclaimer : I cry so much , so freaking much . be prepared to cry in the latter half of the drama . ( this be a good thing , I think!)The romance between the Grim Reaper and sunny be poignant and heart wrench . their history lend their romance more weight but their present romance be fill with charge , tense chemistry all on their own . I love they together honestly ! so much chemistry . everyone \\'s performance be fantastic . I have no complaint . the soundtrack be amazing . OST \\'s of a drama be so important to I in create a more emotional bond with the scene and Goblin \\'s be just on point in every take . every song be utilize so well in the drama and just add so much depth to the scene . now , the not so good : as I mention in the beginning , the drama do tend to linger and prolong many moment , which make they feel long . there be also time , especially in the beginning , where I feel like the plot become a little repetitive . however , the drama definitely become well and fast as the episode go by , maybe because I got use to the length of it , but the plot also get tight and more emotionally thrilling . the ending , to I , feel very bittersweet . I cry load and I feel somewhat unsatisfied . it be very memorable though , so there be that . I definitely recommend Goblin to everyone , if anything , at least to try to see if it fit their taste . disregard the complaint about this drama , especially about the age gap controversy , I still think Goblin be a drama for everyone to at least try because Goblin be so much more than just the romantic relationship . PERFECTION . what more be there to say ? this drama have everything . from romance , to life lesson , to humor and then some . it have everything . it be visually great too ! I be very proud to be one of those people who stay up until the wee hour of the morning to watch this . I be with they when they cry , laugh , get angry or frustrated . that be how much this drama affect I . I find myself do an ugly - cry more time than I care to admit . Goblin surely touch your heart with its life lesson . the entire cast and production team create a masterpiece . awesome job ! ! ! the future of drama be as bright as the Goblin \\'s blue flame ! :) perfection!!!!i\\'m write this review because Goblin be my absolute favorite ! I see the last episode just now ( I be postpone the episode \\'cause I do n\\'t want it to end but I could n\\'t take it any long ) . the ending be n\\'t what I expect but it be nothing less than amazing . the photography of this drama be the good I \\'ve see in my whole life . either in other KDramas , chinese drama , american drama , american movie , french movie ... each frame of this drama be beautifully capture . my congratulation to the team behind this drama . they do a wonderful and beautiful job!Story ( 10 ): just to start ... Gong Yoo . his my oppa ! I really love he and his act skill be amazing . however , his last drama be n\\'t my favorite , not because of his acting , but \\'cause I think they be too previsible . but this one , guy ... I never get bored !   the plot be phenomenal and each character have his own part of the story . the story be about a goblin and his bride , a girl who see ghost ; a grim reaper and a very strong woman and their journey to be together . their past mix with their future . the romance be cute and funny , not lame . it have it all : romance , mystery , fantasy and a lot of bromance and funny moments!acting / Cast ( 10 ): Gong Yoo ... the word speak for themselves . he be the main character , play the goblin . his bride be Kim Go Eun , also amazing but , between the main character , the one I dislike more . even so , 9/10 ! the grim Reaper be my favorite character and be play by Lee Dong Wook . I do n\\'t know he but I fall in love right from the 1st episode . he do an amazing job . Yoo in Na play sunny , that strong woman , who the Grim Reaper fall for . the Grim Reaper and sunny be my OTP ! they have an incredible chemistry on set . I wo n\\'t be talk about the other member of the cast or else I wo n\\'t finish this review today!Music ( 9.5 ): I be completely hooked on \" beautiful \" from Crush . also , on \" you be so beautiful \" , from Eddy Kim ; \" stay with I \" , from Punch feat Chanyeol ; \" I miss you \" , from Soyou , etc , etc .... I give it 9.5 \\'cause it be not the good OST that I have ever listen to , however , it be completely make for the drama and addictive . and that be what matters!Rewatch Value ( 10 ): I never rewatch a drama ! the only thing that I do repeat be film . I sometimes also repeat my favorite scene from the drama I \\'ve see . however , I never rewatch the whole drama . should I correct myself ? I \\'ve never rewatche a whole drama but I \\'ll definitely rewatch this one . not now , I be too sad that it have end however in the near future I \\'ll rewatch it and watch it with new eye and fall in love with it all over again ... PS : there be a kiss between the Grim Reaper and sunny that be very similar to a \" statue kiss \" ( for some reason this type of kiss be a must in every KDrama ) . it be not a really \" statue kiss \" ( thank the god ! ) but it be similar . I just expect a little more at that point as they share great chemistry . but , cheer up ! that be the only bad thing in this drama ! 11/10!!Goblin be the first K - drama I ever watch . and I think it be the good drama so far , hand down . if you have n\\'t watch it , you probably should ... like now!for you question why you should watch it ? here be my reason : if we talk about casting- though I be new to this , I do Google a lot- I do n\\'t think their could n\\'t be any well then this . Gong Yoo do an amazing job . I watch his movie \\' train to Busan \\' and one could say it hand down that he be an amazing actor , who know how to do his job . and God his smile .... Killer!!!I love the 19 year old , over enthusiastic Ji Eun Tak who be portray by Kim Go Eun . the way we get to see how her character grow throughout the series be a treat . I love Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper . I probably have a crush on the character and the way Lee Dong Wook show his emotion in it , be amazing . I totally get it why he want this character so much . sunny be my favorite . she be strong and I be probably never go to see a chicken shop owner the same way .   Yoo in Na , change that for all of we .

I be do this my self - while re - watch the show for the second time . especially love \\' winter be come \\' it be just a wonderful piece to listen too . in short .. the song be perfect . the cast be perfect . the story be incredible . and everything about it ... will make you fall in love with it . so if you be one of those people out there , who have n\\'t see it yet , I would like to tell you .... watch IT.I think this drama just steal the first place in my favorite list ! I laugh , I cry , it move I Bob ! go watch this amazing drama now ! stop read ! honestly , this be the high quality drama I have ever see . not just the good , but the cinematography , the set , the costume , yes even the visual Effects be magnificently amazing . I do n\\'t have to cringe my way through a scene that look fake ! no , instead I would be think \" wow , what amazing camerawork , what an ingenious way to show that , look at that scenery ! ... \" etc , etc , etc . story ( 10.0):I have yet to give a 10 across the board , and rate the story a 10 be almost as rare . this story be literally gobsmackingly amazing ! if you need some context , it remind I of a mix of some of my other favorite drama : healer just for the vibe of secret and connection to be find ; Queen in Hyun \\'s Man for the previous lifetime , man from another time sort of story with an impossible love ; Legend of the Blue Sea with similar feel of previous lifetime and fate character connection , touch of supernatural . but honestly , it be also completely its own thing . it remind I of element from those other drama , but take those and transcend them!goblin be the perfect mix of romance and bromance , comedy and tragedy , love and heartbreak , life and death ... this drama have way more than I ask of it and do n\\'t ever once go off the rail . I wo n\\'t spoil the ending or anything , but at the end of the drama I have so much feel I feel like I \\'d just watch a 50 episode Saeguk instead of a measly 16 episode package of awesomeness!i\\'ve hear some complaint about the lead female role character , but honestly what really make I love this story and make it stick out from all the other drama I \\'ve see be the character and the interaction between the character , the way they try to express their feeling and learn from those around they , the witty banter and dialogue ! I ca n\\'t say how many time I laugh in this drama ! I think episode 10 be my favorite just from this one hilarious bromance scene ... ahhh ! I want to write more about this story because it be pure genius , but I ca n\\'t say much more without give some spoiler . read the plot if you -- never mind just go watch this . acting / cast ( 10.0):perfection . I ca n\\'t say I \\'ve finish anything Gong Yoo have be in and I honestly could n\\'t deal with cheese in the Trap ; nor have I watch much with Lee Dong Wook ... but they be amazing . all those main three ... I seriously ca n\\'t deal with it . the story and dialogue be my favorite part between these three and they deliver the heck out of this . the bromance between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook be just the good . and I be not forget the just as brilliant performance of Yoo in Na and Yook Sung Jae , on the contrary , I \\'ve see these two in other drama , most notably Queen in Hyun \\'s Man and School 2015 , and I love they both there ! how could I not like they here ! I be always so sad to see Yoo in Na in the \" evil \" role like in Secret Garden and you who come from the Stars , so it be a pleasure again to be root for she . I mention I could n\\'t get through cheese in the Trap , but it be nothing to do with Kim Go Eun . seriously , she be perfect for this role and act it out splendidly . at first I be wary of the romance between she and Gong Yoo , and while they be n\\'t my favorite couple out there , they really do a great job together ! it be just great . as far as secondary actor go , I do n\\'t remember one bad actor ... if I remember right , there may have be some of that classic KDrama cheesy English , but no biggie for everything else we get out of this show ! oh , prop for Kim so Hyun ! one of my favorite Actresses , I be so overjoyed to see she in this and she look great in a historical setting ! I be so enjoy see she in ruler : Master of the Mask after her role here in Goblin . music ( 9.5):I really want to give this 10 all the way across the board and honestly this soundtrack be really good ! I even listen to it on its own which I do n\\'t do unless I really enjoy a soundtrack . but it be n\\'t perfect for I as some of the song do n\\'t really fit with I . but I still give it the high possible rating I could without hit that ten mark!Rewatch value ( 10.0):Yes , a 10 . usually my rewatch value match pretty closely to the story value , and this be no exception . the story be just amazing especially the first time through when you do n\\'t know what be go to happen , but the interaction of the character be just such a joy to watch that I \\'ve already start rewatche this ! to be honest with you all , I watch the first half of this drama when it be first come out ; I love it , but stuff happen and I never actually finish the drama ... gasp ! so when I be come back to it , I be like whatever let \\'s watch the first part again , and my rewatching have n\\'t stop from there . this drama ... I do n\\'t think I \\'ll ever stop rewatche it . and I rarely rewatch anything , so yeah , it be good . go watch it so you can rewatch it . overall ( 10.0):How could I not give this drama a ten ? the story be astounding , the acting be incredible , the music be amazing , everything be practically perfect in every way ! I feel like I \\'ve say everything up above but that I still have so much more to say ! I be have trouble express how much I enjoy this without post spoiler ... I \\'ll probably be come back to post new stuff in this review because I know I have more to say about this but it be all flee my mind to be replace with the desire to go watch this again . Annyeong ! ! ! Salanghae ! ! ! p.s. not my long review , only come in at a little over 1.1k word , but it be still a great effort . hope this convince you to go watch this drama . the only word that could come to describe this show would be PERFECTION.Everything about Goblin be set so right that you can never regret watch and rewatche and rewatche it again . story- one of the good fantasy story you will ever come across . it be not only beautifully set , but move forward with a wonderful pace , blend both past and present story together . the story of Goblin be such that you want never want it to end . the funny moment will have you in split and the sad one will rip your heart into piece . acting- tremendous . every actor be on spot with their acting but Kim Go Eun be particularly brilliant . her play a teenager and a mature character be so well put that you will actual believe there be a time gap . music- oh my GOD . I have each track of Goblin and I listen to it almost always . the music add more value to the show . rewatch value -- I\\'ve already see it over 7 time . no matter what show I watch , I always end up go back to this one . overall- without even think about it , go watch it and you wo n\\'t ever regret . goblin?its simply the first drama that I rewatch the scene again and again after 17 year watch kdramas!The story be simple but unique , sad but funny , the detail , cinematography , ost , especially the acting and chemistry be superb . Gong Yoo can even speak his emotion only through his deep eye and smile :) every scene be do perfectly in detail . I admit I do nt expect and feel anything at first series , but the more I watch , the more I hook up and feel their emotion . age difference do nt matter , \\xa0 it happen in real life , 19 be not a child anymore and the writer have to use the 9 magical number to fit the fate storyline . brother to sister love or even father to daughter love ? hahaha ... I think this be exactly what make Goblin so successfull!because deep down in every woman heart , they yearn to have this \" father and brother \" like affection from their man , a sincere love that make woman feel safe and protect , a mature but also cute and humorous man in their stressfull life . some say its overate , maybe because they start to watch with very high expectation . just watch and enjoy the detail , \\xa0 the more it go the well it be . so first of all , I think this drama be really overrated . I really like it but the drama get some flaw that be hard to just overlook . story : I like the story . it be actually pretty interesting and different in a way . some would say that the age gap between the 2 main character be hard to overlook but it be okay for I . what I mean be I be n\\'t really pay attention to that part as the drama be base around something fictional , the age gap be just a part of that .   I like the relation between the two main character but also with the second couple . the bromance be also a very good part of that drama . I just wish Deok Hwa play a big part of the drama . usually , there be some character that I do n\\'t like in a drama , like a big villain but I just like every character here . and also , I enjoy everything regard the Grim Reapers organization and especially the grim reaper ( Lee Dong Wook).Acting / Cast : they all do a great job and I think they all suit their role . Gong Yu as always be a very good actor . I be also very surprised by Lee Dong Wook , if be just perfect as the Grim Reaper . also , Kim Go Eun be a good actress ( that I see in cheese in the Trap before ) but rather than feel sad with she when she cry ( near the end ) I be just impressed . I usually do n\\'t like the cry in drama also so see Lee Dong Wook always with teary eye / crying be kind of hard for I but he do a good job ! I also often find the main female lead annoying but she be okay . music : I think Goblin would n\\'t have be that great without this OST . seriously , the music in the drama be just perfect . all the song be just beautiful . if the music be n\\'t that good , I think I would have rate the drama 7.5 instead of 8.5.rewatch value : I would probably not rewatch it , or I would skip some part . the episode be unnecessarily long . so why do I think Goblin be overrated?- there be ton of flashback and they be always the same ! ! ! that be soooo annoying ! I hate when they do that in drama . like they would put the same flashback twice in the same episode and in almost episode ... and for what ? we do n\\'t forget that happen so why ? this be why the episode be long but it be just long of flashback I think ... it could have be maybe 10 minute short if it be n\\'t for that ... - then , that would n\\'t really affect the rating but it kind of annoy I to some point .. the product placement here it just too strong . so we can see it everywhere and in every drama but usually it be more subtle than that . they be literally say : eat subway and your life will be well . ( or something like that ) . I understand that they need money to have that good quality in the scene but come on ... - then I feel like the story / plot could have be well use ... it be kind of a waste of the character I think . and I want to know more about the deity . so yeah , I be happy I watch it but I wish the realization of the drama and the use of the character would have be well handle . when I finish the drama I have a bitter feeling . I enjoy it and really like it but I feel like the potential be a bit waste . so I think there be many more stuff to talk about regard that drama but I \\'ll just stop here :) anyways , Goblin be a drama that need to be see ! :) this drama be one on my watchlist for a long period of time , exactly 3 year . if I be n\\'t a fan of Gong Yoo , I would n\\'t even watch this . tbh , it be a pretty satisfying romcom if you compare with the other in Kdrama world . be a fan of Kdrama romcom mean you have sign an agreement to comply with the lovey - dovey cringy cliche romance . if you can compromise that , this would be a fun watch . if you want to watch a drama on a serious note , still watch this , cause there be n\\'t many realistic drama out here.seriously I just love this drama so much .. the ending be so filled outand you do n\\'t even yearn for a new season because it end sobeautifully ... I just really like how they sorta make a great conclusionto the love that be happen here and really show we how everythingwill / would end . they do n\\'t leave the ending in the open which honestlyway too many drama do . Goblin be seriously the good drama ihave ever see and the animation and direction of the drama wasgorgeous . the actor be simply perfect and let \\'s be honestthe BROMANCE be ON POINT!Never see this great bromance before!!of course there be probably many demand a new season because they\\'dlike to see more of the ending but I feel like this would ruin the whole ending , it be just too beautiful . this drama should not have anymore episode because it be just dat wellfinished.(special and cut scene be always welcome tho)goblin 10/10goblin . the lonely and beautiful man who have to undergo sadness , happiness , sadness and happiness again . and   he bring along with he the viewer to this roller coaster of emotion . it definitely deserve its hype . it be one of those few drama that actually deserve the hype . it have substance ( very important for I ) and you can not not finish it or else your question about the drama will just remain as question . Most episode leave I at awe and a lot of scene give I goosebump . the second half of the drama be exceptional and I be glad because a lot of drama lose its beauty as they reach the second half . Goblin didn\\'t . Most of all , I love the relationship in the drama specifically of the four main lead : the goblin and his bride , kim woo bin and sunny , goblin and the grim reaper , part timer and her boss , the miss soul and the grim reaper , the queen and his brother , the king and the sister of the traitor , the king and his warrior . and you should never just shrug off the side character — they play significant role to the drama \\'s story . and do I even need to explain why I rate the music a 10 ? the whole universe would agree that Goblin \\'s ost be beyond amazing . and it be n\\'t just their music that be pleasing , the cinematography itself be aesthetically satisfying . I give the rewatch value a 8.5 only because if I rewatch again , I \\'d only focus on the second half of the drama and the humor of the first half ( except episode 1 and 2 those be amazing episodes).overall , Goblin be an amazing drama . not only because I cry a bucket of tear , but because it showcase how rich human ( and nonhuman lol ) relationship can be . how a single person can change your once believe \" life full of punishment , \" how forgiveness can heal not only the person forgive but also you yourself and that actually , the existence of death make life even more meaningful . I ca n\\'t even express myself properly through word * sigh * thank you Goblin . you be a gem . such an emotional rollercoaster , I have never laugh and cry so much with every episode!My Girl \\'s Lee Dong Wook . Coffee Prince \\'s Gong Yoo . admittedly , those two name be the initial reason why I get curious about this drama . later on , it be my 30 - second glimpse of episode five when the male lead be go to the app store ( really crack I up ) that seal the deal . because of that , I be under the impression that this will be just another light rom - com drama with a touch of fantasy . boy be I wrong . I do n\\'t watch any trailer before I start this drama and I be n\\'t prepare for the emotional roller coaster that it put I in . a salad of fantasy , romance , drama , and comedy , Goblin be able to make I laugh , smile , and cry all in one episode . there be no boring episode although I must admit that the last three drag on a bit . though sometimes a bit forced and repetitive , the romance in this drama be good . the actor definitely know what they be do in that area . now the bromance , a favorite of most Goblin fan , be just amazing . ( all cap , people ! ) . have Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook act adorably awkward and goofy in the same screen be now my second favorite thing next to chocolate fudge cake . more importantly , this drama be more than just about love that transcend time and death or about \" destiny outside of man \\'s boundary . \" beyond the witty exchange and the most poetic line I \\'ve hear - or read ( hurrah , subtitle ! ) in a drama , Goblin tackle deep theme about   friendship , life choice , and regret . not to mislead you though , this drama be not perfect . there be a lot of underlie storyline that be undeveloped and could have make the story more awesome than it already be . by the time you realize it though , you \\'ve fall in love with the drama and its character that you wo n\\'t have a choice but to overlook and forgive these plot hole . the good part that I like about this drama ( except for Goblin \\'s and the Grim Reaper \\'s bromance ) be the music . simply put - perfect . I do n\\'t understand korean but the melody and how the song be lay in each scene be so effective I would rate it 11 if possible . there be also some important scene when I expect a background music but instead I be give raw acting and raw dialogue make the scene more effective . last but definitely not the least , I be in awe of the cinematography of this drama . if not for Gong Yoo \\'s face in the first episode , I would n\\'t have be sure if I be watch a k - drama or some Hollywood / chinese fantasy movie . they definitely spare no expense in make this drama . then again , they probably also earn ton from all the advertisement they have . all in all , Goblin be a strange and beautiful drama that be definitely one of the good k - dramas I \\'ve see . one of the good korean Dramas out there . quality from all over the place . from cast and acting , music score , cinematography ( especially Cinematography ) , and even the story - amazing quality . what really make this drama special be the amount of quality it have . the Cinematography be really great . the music be also great . the good part be of course the character , the surprising chemistry and the relationship . the story sound generic when I first read it , and it might be just   a little bit . however , this drama be one step above in all aspect . you have to also pay a bit of attention to the background and other image you see on screen . it be actually very well write . just a fair warning though , lot of crying , especially near the end of the series . but then again , what be \" drama \" without some crying ( there be a LOT though).I have finish this drama a few day ago and I be still speechless . it be just perfect . the cast have a really good chemistry and the story be great . I love the bromance between the grim reaper and the goblin . even more after see the behind the scene footage . I love the two great love story . it be a rollercoaster but it be worth the tear . I enjoy watch the drama because it all fit . the overall appearance be perfect . the people who work behind the drama really do a great job . the costume , the make - up , the stage set , the plot ... everyone who put their blood , sweat and tear into it do an outstanding job . the actor do a great job . after see the bts footage I be even more impressed by they . they do a lot of improvisation and I think this show how good their skill be and how good their chemistry be . the writer do the good job out of everyone . without they the drama would n\\'t have be that good . the plot be so well write with everything just perfectly match . the writer have find the right balance of wit and seriousness . I ca n\\'t say more without spoil everyone . you just have to watch for yourself . it be by far the good drama I have ever see . I write this review with swollen eye still damp from my tear . this fantasy drama I know be nt perfect and its story take on a reflective stand , sometimes choose to dwell on moment . it may feel slow to some but I find it poetic and give time to appreciate the people the place and their life . almost all scene be so beautifully shoot , the scenery be breathtaking and film like . the opening theme to the first ost stay with I already tell you the music for this drama be equally daebakI would never have imagine Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook in the same drama . but there must be drama god hear the people \\'s prayer and hope . the bromance of Goblin and Grim be so spot on , friendship , laughter and more . the main cast all pull their weight from Kim Go Eun whose natural beauty and calibre be suit as bright Eun Tak to Yook Sung Jae and Yoo in Na . even its support cast ( Samshin , Director yoo , Secretary kim ,   Park Joong Won ) be all superb and each have command screenpresence and bring so much to the narration of the story . towards the end I love the message that human though seemingly small and frail compare to deity and the almighty , but we can surprise you with our will that can change the course of fate . and lastly to live and love like its your last day . its so simple but often forget . I \\'ll cherish this drama . and for now there be nt a drama I can recommend that quite capture the gist , the tone , and the feel like Goblin do . that s how unique it be . due to the immense hype this drama receive I be interested like everyone else to see what be behind the drama that get everyone speechless . at the beginning I remember be quite judge towards the duration of the episode because you can easily turn episode with an average of 1h and 15min into a sleeping feast . to my surprise the episode pass really quickly though - which mean they structure they in a way which leave I constantly entertain and/or emotionally tense . the plot by itself be n\\'t that complicated but the flashback to the Goryeo era and the foreshadowing make it more fancy . plothole definitely exist in this drama - especially at the end and I do n\\'t really like their conclusion since it felt rush . what we all need to praise though be the amazing cinematography - it be unlike any other drama I \\'ve ever watch . first of all , at the beginning I be so stunned by everything that be present to I that I honestly think \" how much effort do they put into this it be like a high quality movie \" . the special effect   be n\\'t ridiculous at all and everything harmonize so wonderfully . it keep its well think out quality until the end -   it be seriously a nice experience . drama in the future will have to step up when they want to surpass this drama quality - wise . the second good thing about this whole drama be the cast . the joke be fresh and immensely cute at the same time . be ready to laugh every episode . I think this drama achieve to be deeply emotional but hilarious at the same time without lose its seriousness ? I be also happy that they integrate two male protagonist that harmonize the good out of all the cast member -   and also build a happy trio with Sungjae \\'s character . in addition we really need to take a moment to honor Gongyoo \\'s acting - so incredibly good . all in all , I would definitelly recommend watch this one since it be one of the good drama I \\'ve ever watch . it manage to pull out fresh joke leave and right without have an overused plot . it be indeed worth the hype . this be way overhyped imo . the act , cast , and music be perfect , I ca n\\'t fault that . but Euk Tak be way too whiny , have no chemistry with the Goblin , and they drag everything on for ever.in the end I end up skip a lot of it just so I could finish it and see what happen to sunny and the grim Reaper . they have way more of an interesting story than Eun Tak / Goblin , but I be still a bit disappointed in it . I kinda want a drama with the King / Queen . I do n\\'t know why I be so bored and disappoint with this drama , maybe fantasy do n\\'t do well for I , but then again I love my love from the Star . well at least I can say I watch Goblin , but I wo n\\'t be rewatche it and I be not interested in the special . damn it , I have such high hope . after more than 200 drama and over 100 asian film , the plot of this drama have become my all time favorite . while I \\'ve be on this website for a long time and I \\'ve be watch asian drama and film for over 8 year , I \\'ve never felt compel to write a review . but for this drama , I will . I will watch this drama probably every year , and listen to most of the ost in replay for the next three month . this cast could n\\'t have be more ideal , the acting be superb , and seriously those damn ost be so goooood ! I never skip one second of this drama ( and trust I now a day I skip a lot ) . also let talk about the scenery cause damn every second be beautiful ! everyone work really hard and it show . so sad its over but I be glad it happen . about the age gap : I can not recommend this drama to anyone . the main romance be childish and gross . it be so uncomfortable to watch that I do n\\'t know how I get through it . the main female lead have such a childish character . the undertone of the drama be weird , they should n\\'t have be a couple . People hate other drama for have a weird age gap , but Goblin never gets mention . I think this drama be one of the bad one because their maturity level be not at the same level . if there be go to be an age gap I think writer should consider the maturity need to give real consent . I be glad people be finally start to realize the importance of age gap and real consent though . about the storyline : even besides the romance , the main storyline be confusing . there be more emphasis on aesthetic than the story . I would say watch the first two episode then stop . it go downhill from there .   at one point in the drama , around episode 12 or 13 , I find myself skip through a lot of it . I watch drama for the storyline much more than the cute moment or aesthetic , so if you feel the same way , I do not think you will enjoy this drama . I wish I have write this review when the episode be first come out . it be so weird to see everyone say they love it . about the good part : the music in this drama be fantastic , and , in my opinion , one of the only redeemable quality about it . I love Gong Yoo , but this drama be not it . episode 1 and 2 be exciting for sure , but I can not recommend this drama far than those two episode . Goblin be one of those drama that be highly anticipate right after the much loved dots due to these drama come from the same writer- and Goblin be deserving of this hype as it have everything you want- from romance to suspense to comedy . Goblin truly wrap everything together nicely in order to deliver an enjoyable and heart - wrench drama . the GOODI love the plot line- and the unique synopsis of an immortal goblin need to find his wife to finally end his life after year of suffering as he team up with the Grim reaper to unravel lose secret . of course- romance , mystery and suspense all tie up together with this- and it be beautifully play out . the plot be a bit easy to predict yet it be still full of suspense and plot twist that may throw you in a loop , but it be obvious what will happen in the end as in all of the writer \\'s previous drama . even so , there be quite a few plot twist that will make you on the edge of your seat as usually major development happen within the last few minute of each episode that just make I want to tear out of hair!The music be plain amazing . it fit so well with the drama as every - time a certain melody come up , I be tear up already so it deserve a perfect 10 for I . set aside the obvious love story between the goblin and his wife , I look so forward to the bromance between the grim reaper and goblin and how they slowly begrudgingly become friend as their antic and scene be hilarious . the second romance between the reaper and sunny be heart - wrench yet I be invest in their relationship from the start to finish . the actor and actress be amazing- and I love everyone \\'s acting- although I do find Goblin \\'s bi - polar personality a bit confusing and slightly annoying due to his character switch up all the time . there be some comment on Eun Tak \\'s character and how many be annoy that her character be so young , and I be no exception to these slight feeling of confusion- however that disappear as Eun Tak be perfect ; depict a naive yet bright optimistic 19 year old who struggle throughout her life , yet still manage to see the bright side of thing . to add- everyone probably hear about how Lee Dong Wook have pester / frequently visit the writer in order to get his role- and he be deserving of that . he play the grim reaper beautifully as he really know how to show angst and pain through one look . the BADThere be not much to say about the bad things- other than the weird \\' out of character \\' moment at time . I do find the drama a bit slow near the middle as everything happen quickly within the first few episode ( which be pretty common).The amount of product placement within this drama be overwhelming- to the point where it be get a bit more irritating , but I guess it be fine as drama do need sponsorship and need to show their gratitudeI be also disappointed that the secondary character ( Secretary Kim , Chairman Yu , the mysterious grandma and especially Deok Hwa ) do n\\'t have much screentime near the mid - way point as I enjoy their character . and SO?Despite the small annoyance you may find- you should really watch Goblin as it be a unique drama that be truly deserving of the high rating as not only the ost be outstandingly beautiful- everything about this drama will temporary satisfy every drama - lover \\'s insatiable hunger!!goblin ... I fall in love hard in this drama . I be so captivate by Gong Yoo\\'s(Goblin ) pain and Kim Go eun\\'s(ji Eun Tak as Goblin \\'s bride ) emptiness and hardship . the great thing about this drama be that even if you know where the plot be go , you still enjoy the acting . I can feel Gong Yoo\\'s(Goblin ) anxiety on how to tell Kim Go Eun(Goblin \\'s bride ) that he like she and that he want to be with she constantly , that he worry every time for Kim Go Eun(Goblin \\'s bride ) , when she be not anywhere near his sight and he be always there for she to save she and go anywhere with she . the setting of this drama ... I can never ever say anything bad about it . you be in the maple country , you can see the beautiful maple tree , the sign of autumn , how can I forget how beautiful that be ? add the beautiful OSTS this drama have , as well as the 2nd male lead(lee Dong - wook as Grim Reapear ) and 2nd female lead Yoo In - na(sunny / Sun Hee ) . how can something go wrong?I feel like I be watch this live , and I be there on the set with they especially when the episode 13 come up where in I cry so hard as Kim Go Eun(Goblin \\'s bride ) cry her heart out . I be really catch up with the scene and I salute Kim Go Eun \\'s cry in there . it feel so real that you can really think she be cry for her real life love . this will be one of the drama \\'s I will never ever forget . I do n\\'t expect less from Gong Yoo \\'s acting since Coffee Prince . he be one of the most seek after actor and I always look forward to his work . this drama be one of the most beautiful piece of art I have ever have the pleasure of see . if you be at all hesitate to watch this drama due to overhype or worry about the genre I beg you watch it . it change my entire perspective on what a kdrama could be . I be sad I ca n\\'t go back to rewatch it for the first time , to experience it anew , again and again . that first watch be truly magic . to allow yourself to experience this drama be a gift . allow I to expand on some of the specific of why Goblin be life change . if you know I you know that I be obsess with character and character development . this drama be chock - full of amazingly write character and all go through massive transformation . the stagnation in the Goblin and Grim Reaper \\'s life disappear when they meet their soul mate . as a plot device this use of love and lover be refreshing as it be definitely the man who change for their love ( instead of the usual over - accommodate woman who plague dramaland ) . aside from character there be the aesthetic . Goblin have a massive budget and it be clearly see in every facet of the drama . the cinematography deserve unending praise , the acting be of the high quality , the plotline be refreshingly unique . their set , wardrobe , world be immersive in the utmost . the atmosphere these minor detail create lend itself perfectly to the story and make the mood create by the actor and writer to be all the more real . Goblin \\'s melancholy , something that so many drama try and fail to achieve , be breathtaking . as I have say before I love sad drama . this drama make I cry every episode , and not because it be ridiculously melodramatic . Most of the time it be the side story I cry over ( the Grim Reaper \\'s side plot ) . these story , so superfluous to the main plot , show the exacting attention to detail that be use in this drama . they be move , beautiful , heartbreaking story and they leave you feel both empty and full . full of life and a love for humanity . Goblin \\'s great achievement , in my opinion , be empathy . every character ( or at least every character we do n\\'t necessarily hate ) can be empathize with . every episode you can change who you most identify with and yet never feel disconnected from any other character . this be a feat so difficult to accomplish that I have only ever encounter it in Anna Karenina before . I know this review be n\\'t the most informative but I feel that the emotional response to Goblin that I and so many other feel be the good possible recommendation and review I can give . when a series have such a high rating , there be only one explantion for it : it appeal to a majority of people . and what appeal to a majority of people ? something that be simple . well , honestly , Goblin be really beautiful . if you want to watch something nice , calm and beautiful - watch Goblin . I can not imagine that there be people out there who do n\\'t like it or do n\\'t enjoy it . the cinematography , the music , the scenery - spectacular . the good I have ever see in any korean drama to date . so why the rather low rating ? it have no substance . the story be n\\'t very exciting . after four episode I feel like I know everything I have to know about the main couple . what keep you watch then ? the love story of the Grim Reaper , I guess . unfortunately he and sunny only have a few scene in every episode while the main couple be go back and forth . again and again . there be so many recap later on ( I do n\\'t know when it start to annoy I ) , many flashback , I feel like they recycle scene . the end product be somehow very artistic ( I will admit that ) , but the story in general be n\\'t very deep . the emotion could n\\'t reach I . if I compare Goblin to the drama korean Odyssee I recently watch I must say that the latter make I cry and weep like a baby many time while I have a hard time feel sad for the Grim Reaper or the Goblin . I cry when the old man climb the stair to heaven and his dog be there wait for he - just say . that be sad . maybe it be because of the comedy between the two character ( there be comedy between the couple too ) , but even though they have a tragic past , they live pretty good live for a very long time . I mean even if they would have die at the end of the series ( for real ) they have a satisfying life . this series be in general very \" satisfying \" . every single moment feel satisfying . I just think there be no real reason for be sad . I feel like they share too many tear that could n\\'t reach I . so to make it short : story : 4/10 ( not much depth ) , but the execution be 10/10 , so I wil give it a solid 7acting : 9 ( because I think Lee Dong Wook could have do a well job , I like he a lot more in \" scent of a Woman\")Music : 10 ( it can not get any better)rewatch value : well , if I want to relax and enjoy something that be beautiful for the sake of be beautiful ... 8.if you be look for a drama to binge - watch before go back to exam/ work - stress life , go spend your precious time in other drama instead . go in with high hope cuz everyone be talk about how good it be but nopestory : plot be original and I like the whole concept of this goblin and grim reaper + cinematography be amazing ngl . however . the pacing be too slow for my liking . one scene of Eun Tak look at the leave can take about 3 minute and the age gap between the lead be disturbing ( idk abt the rest but def be disturb to I ) . halfway through the drama , I just skip through the love line of the main lead because it be lengthy and boring and instead , be more interested in the second lead love line - which indeed be love by many more and they even get their own drama afterwards .   overall , concept be good and unique , but pacing be too slow and there be many small problem in between.cast : needless to say , cast be amazing in act . I especially like SungJae \\'s and Dongwook \\'s acting . music : get ta give credit to the music , very suited for the drama and vibe hahaOverall , something I would nt want to rewatch again because its too slow and boring for my liking . one day I want to watch a romance but this be n\\'t just a romance you do n\\'t just watch it you feel it .   it steal your heart . in the beginning you watch their feeling grow normally like in any normal show but this be n\\'t a normal show which you can see during the first scene , the whole sword thing , and flash back . this show have more . you \\'ll laugh , you \\'ll smile , you \\'ll feel your heartbeat , but most of all you \\'ll cry . it be not a sad show it be just everything . the cast be great . the story be great . the production be great . I ca n\\'t bash a single moment . just as I be get bored with it it spin I around and steal all my focus again . no this be n\\'t just a show it be a art piece for age to come . I highly highly recommend it . I do n\\'t write many review , but I cut and paste this from my own comment on a YouTube video of the Ailee song . I start write just a brief comment but get a little emotional as my love for this drama came pour out . when watch K drama without know their year of release , you can often sense if a drama come before / after Goblin . this masterpiece usher in new standard of storytelling scope , production value and cinematography to korean drama and everyone else scramble to keep up . from the first frame to last it feel like you be watch a top - drawer movie with every scene perfectly compose , framed and light . the Goblin \\'s house itself ( a character all in it be own right ) be a masterpiece of endlessly interesting set - design and dressing , but the exterior also , whether they be the many fantasy / historical sequence or more mundane Seoul street be all realise with love care and attention to detail . and do n\\'t get I start on the canadian scene ... the casting too be utterly perfect ; Kim Go Eun be the ultimate girl - next - door type ( 옆집 소녀 ha ! ) , Gong Yoo with his masterful ability to go from hard - as - nail - hero to tender suitor , right down to Yook Sung Jae \\'s fragile naivety . and that be before we get to Lee Dong Wook and Yoo in Na \\'s perfect \" second couple \" - so successful they spawn a spin - off industry that be be go ever since . the ost be easily a match for the high standard of the visual . I own the double - cd pack of this and still play it nearly every day 2 year after first watching . everyone have their favourite OST song from Goblin , but the Ailee classic remain one of the absolute high water mark of korean drama ost . Goblin remain an utter game changer in k - drama and the first few second of this video ( Kim Go Eun \\'s crying scene ) be part of the reason why . I stumble upon this video in a bored moment and the emotion instantly come flood back and I well up with tear , not just from the raw moment show here ( a Kim Go Eun act masterclass ) , but from the lifelong memory give to I by this wonderful wonderful drama . I know it will sound ridiculously over the top , but for I at least , television be never the same again . overall the drama be worth watch . cast be select very well for their role . Cinematography be very good . I   sob . I do n\\'t know how much tear I have shed watch this drama . what a sad love . I finish the whole drama . I be very interested in the story line but be dissapointe . the main couple \\'s relationship feel icky to I due to the maturity difference . the actress be super cute but there seem to be a disparity in how the goblin and she interact . it be n\\'t like move deep emotion , \\xa0  you almost just feel like they be just \" cute \" . the pacing be just about right . I actually like the side storyline well . I enjoy the acting but for some reason not the casting . I would n\\'t recommend . this drama be absolutely worth watch . I can say it because initially I be n\\'t ready to watch it though there be too much craze about it , I feel its just another historical + present time story but I be totally wrong   and I be so glad I watch it . story : the story be just amazing , it be totally something new and dramatic in a good way . the suspense and excitement be maintain even till the last . you totally fall in love with romance , comic scene , action and all of   those element . its a throughout entertainment and the story do n\\'t drop low anywhere , each episode and scene be worth watch . acting / cast : such big actor wih their flawless acting will make you love each and every character they play . Gong Yoo be a serious goblin and happy soul both be interesting , Kim Go Eun be so cute and adorable in this drama , Lee Dong Wook alert ! you might have a SLS problem here , Yoo Na in be damn good also add glam to the drama and Yook Sung Jae add up to the comic portion , even the minor character act great . music : OST be great and totally suit the on go situation in the drama . re - watch value : yes you can actually watch it again and I definitely will . so I can totally conclude that this drama should be watch , it will make you laugh , cry , feel relaxed and totally thrilled . it can make you feel all of that so go for it without think once . all be perfect ! ! ! OST be the good ... the story be unpredictable and not so complicated . they make I laugh , smile , tear and cry a lot ! ! ! what can I say ? ? ? for I this be the good drama I watch no.1 in my heart lol . thank you Goblin for this beautiful drama!first three to four episode be slow . lot of historical background .   it take many month for I to return to this show because I stop at like episode 4 or 5 .   that be a lot of investment ( each episode be 1 + hour ) , but I give up because of the pace . the romance be attempt , but it be n\\'t there between the two lead .   there be no chemistry between they . great actor who act well , but no spark . I only stay for the bromance . it be bromance show . and a commercial . this show have the most advertisement I \\'ve ever see . probably have the amount I \\'ve see in my entire life . the age gap between the lead though be too uncomfortable . make the dude a 1,000 year old God at least in the body of someone who look 25 or 30 instead of 40 ! the girl be in high school for God \\'s sake . it seem too predatory with a 40 year old dude wait for her finish high school . this show murder I , I be deceased . it be be 3 day since I finish watch it and I be still think about it and feel residual emotion . Gong Yoo as Kim Shin / Goblin be captivating . I love every scene that he be in and the feeling that Gong Yoo bring to the character make the show for I . I be a little unsure about Ji Eun Tak at first since she act so young but I feel like her character be everything Kim Shin need . she mature quite a lot as the show go on as well as keep some endearing childish quality about she . so , although there be a lot of controversy surround her age , I think that it be fitting for how the show develop . the Grim Reaper be perfect , his awkwardness and dead - pan personality . the relationship between he and Kim Shin be one of the reason l love the show so much . I have so many emotion watch Goblin . I laugh and I cry and I love the character endlessly . a few episode in the middle be slow than the rest , but it do n\\'t phase I . I have n\\'t watch a fantasy drama before this one and I find I really love the element . I be check out more fantasy drama as we speak . the music blow I away , I \\'ve be listen to the soundtrack ever since . the good song , in my opinion , be round and round , beautiful , and I be here , stay with I and heaven . if I listen to and I be here there be a 99 % chance I will start cry again . I feel the need to go back and rewatch it the moment I finish it , so it be no doubt a drama I will be watch again countless time . at first I do n\\'t want to watch this , because it be popular and still air . however after some time after release full dorama I give it try . I do n\\'t expect so many feeling . it make I laugh , sad and cry . I really love it , because story be amazing , but still end leave I in tear . main actor who play Goblin be much old than main actress who play his Goblin \\'s bride , so it be hard to imagine something between they at first . but I got use to all of it . well , this drama be undoubtedly a deserving hit in the area of kdrama . it be just that Kim Eun Sook be really one of the good screenwriter of kdrama , as she manage to create absolutely fulfilled and fresh story , where even the secondary story - line have their power . the only disadvantage of her work be that the last episode become drag and a bit too sweet but as it be something common in the drama ( the exception would be probably the good kdrama screenwriter Noh Hee Kyung , the author of that Winter the Wind Blows and it be ok , that be Love ) , I guess we should simply get use to it ... however , Goblin be my favorite Kim Eun Sook \\'s drama and there be a lot of reason . firstly , here we find a really strong mystical atmosphere and an interesting world with its own rule ( I can not appreciate the perfect musical choice witch make you really submerge into the fictional world ) . also the humor side here be one of the good in the korean area . another wonderful thing be , obviously , an incredible cast and the diversity of original character . it be really nice to see such a charming character as Lee Dong Wook \\'s grim Reaper , the main lead be also very good , then Kim Go Eun , Yook Sung Jae ...   and there be so many moment you can watch for a thousand of time and so few moment you prefer to skip ... so , undoubtedly 10 ;) you ca n\\'t skip even a second with this drama . with the good storyline , cast and production . just wow ! and even 3 year have pass , once I hear its ost , the feeling seem yesterday , that moment I finish watch the drama . very nostalgic that you \\'d want to watch it over and over again . full pack of emotion , from romance , hope ,   and the bromance between Kim Shin and the grim reaper , I think I ca n\\'t get over that ever . sunny and the grim reaper have the good chemistry of all time , it be such a sad love story but have a very realistic ending . \"My sister , my friend , my bride , have all leave . as always I be leave alone\"I\\'d say , this be one of the most unique story I \\'ve see yet , with the most gorgeous cinematography . one of the good thing about it be the actor , especially the male lead and the second male lead , they be totally mesmerizing ( No Homo ) , one could actually   feel their sorrow and grief . another thing about this show be it be ost , each track perfectly fit with whatever situation be give , and that track that play during the goblin and reaper walk < 3.fav track from the show : Lasse Lindh - Hush / stay with I - Chanyeol & PunchThere \\'s one thing I agree with those who bitch about it ... that cringe , the age gap ... Ig 19 and 39(by his look ) ( 938 if you consider his real age ) be n\\'t much of a difference in Pakistan xD. at sometimes he look like her father , especially that moment when he pat her head . if compare with the second couple , I \\'d definitely choose the latter . be Goblin : the Lonely and great god good ? .. yes . be be it great ? ... definitely yesss . should I recommend it ? .. yes if you can bear with its slow pacePersonal Ratings : 9/10sauce : Goblin : the Lonely and great godwhen skim over   review on this website for drama recommendation , I ’m sure that most fellow drama watcher can agree that you should take what \" critic \" sometimes   say with a pinch of salt , especially when a drama get 10/10 on all category .   of course , it ’ human nature that our taste differ from one another . I ’m sure most drama watcher   have be in my shoe , where someone will blatantly say to you that \" this drama , be the good one in the world \" , and when you come to watch it via their recommendation , you ca n’t get even get through the first ten minute of it   without internally scream at the screen . Goblin be no exception . I remember the first time watch   Goblin and as one of my first few korean drama    , I be undeniably   a biased fan . I   deny a lot of evident   fault which have arise to my   attention in the drama , because I have be     enchant from episode one by    the show ’s    cinematography .   ( as a fan of Ghibli Movies , the drama remind I a lot of the detail behind character and set put   into some of my personal favourite ) . for a long time , I remember maintain this biased opinion upon Goblin , until , I gain a new perspective from a friend who have never watch Goblin ( though she have see a lot of   korean drama before ) , and out of curiosity ,    I ask she to give her own honest feedback after   watch it . her own thought on   the drama ? she hate it with the passion . it surprise I a lot when she give I   her honest feedback on the show . we ’d nearly always see eye to eye    on movie , show and book , so , it be surprising that her opinion differ so greatly from my own . out of curiosity , I ask she to elaborate on what annoy she about it . her list be certainly   endless , but , it do help to bring to mind even at the time , the classicmarmite slogan    ; you either love it , or you hate it , and , Goblin be truly one of the two for drama fan .I’ll be honest in say that my thought on the show do n’t magically change overnight , however , my friend ’s criticism do make I rethink a lot about my biased view on the drama . as a consequence , I decide to rewatch it , and it be only through watch again   without rose - tint glass , that I begin to understand   my original thought that I have bury down in place of my love for the drama ,   after watch   the show again .First off , I will agree with nearly all of the review , that Goblin be   a fairly original drama . the blockbuster hit across Korea and overseas , do present   a fascinating   combination   of korean mythology in a modern day set with intriguing   character , an unforgettable OST and of course beautiful backdrop setting as well . so , where can we find any fault , with   it then?first off , the episode length between 70 - 80 minute . of course , in comparison to some drama , Goblin be about average for a korean tv programme .   it   do   come to my attention , however , that in a lot of drama review , few critic have actually bother to mention simply slow- pace some episode become when a \" short \" storyline be   pace for nearly   three hour , rather than finish in one complete episode in order to progress the storyline . arguably , the drama do use some of this time to establish some key technique , not least introduce our protagonist and foreshadow late event as well . on the other hand , it still remain prominent exactly how key writer Eun Sook and of course the cast , be able to truly establish our character in this seemingly endless amount of hour as well . Gong Yoo ’s performance as Kim Shin , be fairly impressive . I ’ll be honest in say , Gong Yoo be not notably memorable in comparison to other performance that I ’ve see by actor , however , he still portray   his role with a level of emotional appeal for viewer . portray a former   general trap in a cursed immortal body ,   I ’m sure you can imagine the amount of raw appeal and question of philosophy which be arise by thought of immortality and morality within the show . on the other hand , it do come to my obvious attention watch the drama again ( and a share criticism by my friend ) , that Eun Sook have leave out a lot of realistic quality and characterisation technique for Kim Shin . this be because Eun Sook have write not suggest any truly profound   psychological or ponder quality towards a man who have live for nearly a millennium   with   \" no love interest \" .   whilst I appreciate the romantic element of \\' first love \\' in the drama and of course concept of chastity   in korean culture , it be beyond ridiculous for Eun Sook to even mildly hint that    an adult man who have live for century ,   have   never have a   one night stand nor interest in   any woman before Eun Tak . by far , Eun Sook do give   Ji Eun Tak some story write justice   . this be explore brilliantly by   Kim Go Eun take upon a young , yet arguably   a more complex   portrayal of an adolescent at the time and Eun Sook makingEun Tak a   more relatable and empathic character to   audience than Kim Shin . sadly , this   do n’t entirely   mean that she be   a more \\' flesh - out \\'   protagonist   either .   whilst it be   certainly a lot more believable upon Eun Tak ’s pass fancy for Kim Shin and her old classmate ,   Eun Sook seem to be focus a little too much upon Eun Tak as a   \\'   young schoolgirl \\' for a major proportion of the drama , highlight an unrealistic   correlation between her naivety   against her age , intelligence and   circumstance   show within   the show . as a consequence , this do raise a lot of issue with the age difference   between an emotionally vulnerable high schooler and an adult man as well . be I be biased and argue it would have be different if Kim Shin have be give to a \" young and fresher \" actor like Sung Jae instead ? no . the age gap be not actually the main problem , it seem .   whilst the issue of   gap certainly raise an eyebrow for I early on within the show , I ca n’t deny that the setup between the two character   do explore   a maturation of different love form between the two lead from friend to near family to a romantic setting in a   somewhat gradual   development for audience . where my   criticism   lie be certainly within   the factor that neither lead be truly explore because of this age gap , as be realistic love interest for    one another . there be no exploration of emotional trial , similar taste or expand their feeling realistically to one another at all within the show , even in the apparent emotional conclusion of the final episode . then of course aside from our main lead , there ’ also the portrayal of the grim   reaper   ( Dong Wook ) , sunny ( Yoo In - Na ) and spoil Chaebol heir   Yoo Deok Hwa   ( Yook Sung Jae ) . with regard to his role as the Reaper , Dong Wook interestingly say in an interview once , his embarrassment at not live down his role in the show and it ’ easy to see why . Dong Wook ’s portrayal from the seemingly callous and   sardonic figure to   a   soft - hearted soul , add to some more touching and humorous   moment   in a show centralise upon romance . aside from his comically heart -driven romance with sunny , the Reaper ’s relationship with the Goblin be portray in brilliant fraternal - style for audience which will easily make you laugh and your heart break within later scene in the show . although there be   some out -of -place line and cheesy acting moment , Eun    Sook do undeniably do Dong Wook justice in this role , however , in a similar manner to Shin and Eun Tak , there be a lot of leave out realism within the Reaper , especially   psychologically . it ’ undeniable that sunny and the Reaper ’s relationship have a level of comical chemistry between essentially a naive man with lack social interaction , and a social butterfly each seek their own comfort within one another ’s company .   Yoo In - Na do give a genuine sense of authenticity within her portrayal as a healthy sister figure for Eun Tak as a character , something which   thankfully do n’t   drive downwards into the typical cliche of female animosity , however , in   a slightly more honest manner ,   Yoo In - Na nor Eun Sook , truly add anythingjovially new to the cliche female flirt role of sunny . whilst she do play her role intriguingly later on within the show , for a high percentage of the drama , she be a perfect example of a \\' stock female lead \\' ; flirtatious , comical and a perfect plot device , but certainly not a sincere human be with with any exposure in flashback , relationship prior to any of the other protagonist    or expression of any   sincere emotion . in a similar manner whilst   Yook Sung Jae do n’t shine out as much as Go Eun or Dong Wook , his performance be still surprisingly well retain as the stereotypical \" spoilt heir \" who show a deep side to his personality during the course of the show . my big complaint with Eun Sook ’s characterisation of Deok Hwa be that there be a lot of brimmed   potential with Sung Jae ‘s portrayal . rather than give Sung Jae any justice in a similar manner to In - Na , Sung Jae be leave as the sort of stock \\' clown character \\' of the drama . what make this even more ironic be that   Eun Sook suggest later in the show   a more complex and intriguing quality to Deok Hwa , which be unsurprisingly disregard later that episode and once he have be of use to this particular storyline , Deok Hwa be nearly entirely disregard as a character by the ending of episode 16.in addition to this portrayal of character and questionable storyline , there ’ the other slightly more trivial complaint of excessive product placement . whilst this do n’t entirely take away from the originality of the plot , see a Subway or a placement for Paul ’s Boutique   in the middle of a scene which could have be use for original character progression and storyline   consider Eun Sook ’s miss link , do irk I a bit personally . critically , I think it ’ fair to say that I can only give you my personal thought on the drama . Goblin be one of those show which you you sort of have to   watch yourself to work out whether you love it or hate it .   there will be   some people who have entirely disagree with everything that I ’ve say in this review , and arguably some who have feel the same as well , and that , be perfectly entitle either way . regardless of your thought on the matter , Goblin have strength and fault for everyone , but it ’ certainly a show you should n’t miss out upon as well . i\\'m just confuse how my fave korean drama get 8.6 and I see several review give this awesome show a low rating . I just do n\\'t understand it .   I lose count on how many time I rewatche this show because it be so good . the story , the character , the soundtrack , the acting be all perfect so I wonder some give this a low rating or maybe they be so perfectionist . for those who be new to korean drama , do n\\'t mind those who give a low rating because they be party - pooper , do n\\'t rely on their review and just enjoy the show . it feel like a majority of I watch this drama be just wait for thing to start happen — the pacing of it be a LOT slow than I expect , and part of that be why I never could full get into it . a lot of people have hate on the ending say it be chaotic and rush , but I actually find that I really enjoy those episode and the episode where there be big reveal . other than that , every one - hour episode feel twenty time as long . the antagonist that start to be introduce near the middle of the drama be something that really intrigue I , especially give the parallel storyline — but it feel like the character and tension be never really explore fully . it be solve quickly and seem to be use more as a plot device for separate the main couple . speak of the main couple — I do n\\'t think I be ever fully on board with they . the relationship always feel more familial , and age gap aside , I just do n\\'t feel any chemistry between they . I also do n\\'t like the secondary ship as much because the relationship just seem to lack any content and connection aside from they be fate . overall the arc for both ship feel repetitive . there be a few thing that I appreciate about the ending . but other thing that I do n\\'t like . I be also a time - skip - hater , but for some reason , I do n\\'t dislike it as much in Goblin , but I be not sure if it have to do with I not be emotionally invest at all or if it feel more in line with the way the plot be going.(full disclosure : I \\'ve get some basic philosophical difference with the theme of this show , so that might have to do with I not click with it — more specifically , it be the idea of romantic destiny that I kind of scoff at.)have you all read the synopsis and you be feel uncomfortable because of the age gap ? do n\\'t let that cause you to miss on a truly amazing series with excellent acting from the cast , hard work from everyone clearly see in every scene , and a story that   be well write .   also with mature / seasoned ( lol very funny bro moment / interaction ) male lead ! I only give it a 9 , story wise , because of the unfortunate and uncomfortable part of the age gap of the primary couple in the story - 18 go on 19 and 939 ( 30s-40s male in appearance ) .   the age gap make it uncomfortable , but I wo n\\'t give a horrible rating just because it make I uncomfortable , especially when everyone work hard to produce such a fantastic series . you see that , as you get to know the character , there be nothing disturbing or corrupted go on between they . the lead character Kim Shin ( Gong Yoo / Gong Ji Cheol ) & Ji Eun Tak ( Kim Go Eun ) be very respectful of each other , with adorable moment that make you fall in love with they . with this series , I be pleased to see that although the secondary couple of the Grim Reaper / Kim Woo Bin / Adult Wang Yeo ( Lee Dong Wook ) & sunny aka Kim Seon / Kim Sun ( Yoo in Na ) meet with tragedy , they be not forget . at the start of watch this I have to keep remind myself I be still on episode 1 or 2 as the story get deep , the character more real / solid and the drama intensify . be prepared to be take on an emotional roller coaster where just as soon as you find yourself cry , you be laugh in the next moment . these actor be incredible ! I be hope there be a season 2 before the end of episode 1 . it be so enjoyable , I do n\\'t even realize each episode be 70 + min long , which I be grateful for because I just do n\\'t want it to end .   also , do anyone see the goblin & reaper design on the pillow / roll towel in episode 4 ? nugget like that make watch so fun . I be in love <3   also actorsKim Byung Chul ( Park Joong Hun [ Goryeo eunuch ] ) and Jo Woo Jin(Kim do Young [ Yoo Shin Woo \\'s secretary ] ) favor each other so much I think there be one actor play both roles!episode 6 when grim say I love you & Goblin \\'s reaction as well as in episode 7 with the scary movie , those be unforgettable scene lol then Episode 11 ... man all of they ! ! I cry nearly every episode ... the ending bring everything full circle , with all that wonderful , heart - wrench , tear jerk , suspense fill moment come to a cheesy but sweet end for the secondary couple and solid start for the primary couple . though with the primary couple this , unfortunately , bring back the issue of the age gap . I be so happy to see they together but disappoint that the school girl with the a much old man concept come back . why could n\\'t they have arrange for they to meet after she finish college ? also , it leave we wonder about how thing turn out for Yoo Deok Hwa ( Yook Sung Jae).So try not to let the age gap cause you to miss out on a great series!first , and most importantly : I love one ( 1 ) doom , socially awkward , trouty mouth , puppy dog - eyed grim reaper . the mix of genre ( fantasy , horror , romcom ) be very seamless , create a precarious world of the living and the dead . with the length of the episode , the series could develop and redevelop relationship again and again in a way that feel natural -- the good example be the Goblin and the Grim Reaper who move from enemy to begrudge roommate to friend . my only nitpick be that while most of the soundtrack be gorgeous and cinematic , there be a few song that be pretty saccharine to the point that it be distract . not enough to keep I from frantically try to explain the premise of this series to every person with ear , though . this drama leave I with a bag full of tissue and a heart full of memory , however , it do not make I think it be the good drama I \\'ve ever see . I hope people just do n\\'t watch it because of the enormous recognition it get , believe I , it be not it overrated , it have everything , \\xa0 amazing CG and scenery , phenomenal set and prop , and the amazing work the actor transfer through the screen . before watch this drama I have never hear anything about Goblins because where I grow up it be not implant in my culture if you be in the same situation I do hope you know this story do n\\'t actually use many characteristic of \" real \" goblin , the one in book , most of it be fabricate by the writer , which have an amazing imagination to pull it off so smoothly with a sprinkle of fantasy . it easily become a drama blockbuster in South Korea without any doubt . oh my Goblin ... I \\'ve always be a Gong Yoo stan since his Coffee Prince day , so there be no way I be let this show go without I watch it . before I meet oppa Ji Chang Wook , because of Gong Yoo \\'s hiatus in the drama land , my heart got sway , but he will always remain as my first love . lol . obviously , he be the main reason I watch this show . and to add ice to the cake , the writer be Kim Eun Sook ! I personally believe she be one of the good rom - com writer out there . what I love most about this drama be their comedic antic especially between goblin and the grim reaper . their chemistry be on point , even much well than the chemistry between goblin and his bride . sadly , for I , GY and Kim Go Eun do n\\'t have that much chemistry . but do n\\'t get I wrong , their acting be good . it be just that they do n\\'t have that vibrant chemistry . Lee Dong Wook and Yoo in Na \\'s chemistry be even well than they ! so love their love story.<3some say , the series go downhill after ep 14 and the ending be force and I somewhat , quite agree . but I also do n\\'t know how to end it any other way that would satisfy the viewer , so I have accept the ending as good enough . rewatch value - if I will watch this again , I will only watch this because of goblin and grim reaper . and Sung Jae , too ! lolP.S. this drama have one of the good soundtrack ever ! I will go to you like the First Snow lyric be so heartbreaking . I also love how the writer add a poetic touch to the script.:)This show be so incredible , I ca n’t wait to spread the word . there be a reason Goblin be rank # 2 in popularity on MDL….and here be why … .. the development of all the character and how they be weave together … … so so so so so unbelievably cool . story : warning : the beginning of this show be really bloody….might be off put if you be look for a lighthearted tale . Goblin be many thing but it be not fluffy nor be IT cute ! the Goblin or Kim Shin be play to PERFECTION by Gong Yoo ( yes….adde he to my oppa list ) . Kim Shin become a goblin after he be betray by the king and the people mourn his death . he wait for a goblin bride who can remove the magic sword and let he leave mortality … .. nine hundred year later ( and a lot of good deed ) he meet up with Ji Eun Tak ( well do by Kim Go Eun ) a graduate high school senior ( and orphan ) , become room mate with a grim reaper ( HOLY COW – Lee Dong Wook rock it ) and Deok Hwa ( Yook Sung Jae … so funny ) , the late member of a family who have take care of the goblin for the last 900 year . throw in a funny business owner name sunny , a mother earth type god , and the big boss god who sometimes come in the form of a butterfly , and well … .. magic … … just magic . some have issue with the age gap between the ML & FL . I think the issue lie in the fact that she be graduate from high school when she meet the goblin and that be a bit much for a few folk . the show steer clear from become inappropriate . perhaps it would have be easy for some if she have already graduate … .. but I ’m not quite convinced . ( however , that weirdness do keep this from be a perfect 10 in my book.)characters : I ca n’t say too much about these character without spill the bean with some spoiler .   please know that I be just skim the surface here . Kim Shin ( Gong Yoo ): all the broody goodness I love in my male lead and super hilarious to boot . Kim Shin will either make you laugh or cry or sigh , but you wo n’t be bored….however , just know that the grim reaper will do the exact same thing ! either way , Gong Yoo … .I just ca n’t image anyone else play this part … … and the relationship between the grim reaper and the goblin … .out of this WORLD CRAZY GOOD!Ji Eun Tak ( Kim Go Eun ): her character be all over the place and in a good way . just when you think she would be too miserable to deal with….she turn into someone funny , running circle around the goblin and the grim reaper . her character could have be too sad and too depressing but Kim Go Eun keep she hilarious and appeal for all 16 episode . sunny & Grim Reaper : holy cow be these two character the good in the entire world . again , avoid spoiler , I will only say : funny , scary , intense , sad , touching , sweet , heart - wrench . watch the show just for these two!!!!music : I will admit that I be tempt to download the theme song because of the last couple of minute of episode 2 ( wasn’t that so cool ! ! ! ) . the music be not repeat to the point of annoying and again … that main song….love it!REWATCH value : oh yeah … .i could watch this over and over and over especially the BROMANCE scenes … .. and there be lot and lot of YouTube video show they over and over because they be SOOOOOOOO AWESOME.Should you watch this ? um yeah . if all my cap do n’t convince you then…….well , just say . my first k - drama , and one I revisit periodically .   the storyline be original -   a man destine to continue live to atone for crime in his past .   I \\'d like to address the age difference - I can see why some people really have a problem with it , especially since she spend so much time in a high school uniform .   however , the chemistry between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun be amazing .   when watch Gong Yoo - his loneliness be almost palpable and be heartbreaking to see .   Kim Go Eun be able to vacillate back and forth between her pitiful life and her vivacity as she get to know Kim Shin ( Yoo ) well .   the secondary love story between Lee Dong Wook and Eu in Na be lovely as well .   there be a lot of humor ( like when he tell she his name be Kim Woo Bin ! ) , but such sadness as well .   the scenery be just beautiful when they be in Canada .   the music be absolutely perfect .   each song fit perfectly where it be use and there be a haunt quality about a number of the song .   these song be easily recognizable when you hear they outside of the show .    but I think the thing that I love well about this show be the friendship between the character , especially between Goblin and Reaper .    if you look up the word Bromance in the dictionary , you should find their picture there - what start out as hate , move to grudging respect , and then finally brotherly love .   their scene never fail to make I laugh .   this be one of the few show that I have watch multiple time , and have enjoy it just as much each time . great show with great story telling.it could get 10 but 9.5 be enough . I be wonder after watch this drama and rewatche within a week.everyone will love the love story of goblin and it be bride they will also drop tear for grim - reaper love story. ❤ ️Gong yoo my beloved actor . I watch all his show after watch goblin . I have to say Yoo perfect his roll as a goblin . his supernatural   activity with grim reaper will amaze viewer . while I be write this , a goblin song play in the background . overall it be perfect love story .. I love the high quality of this drama , it be extremely well make . the story be certainly intriguing in that it keep you wonder how all the conundrum could ever be rectify ; the story portray a veritable railing again the god if you will .   the character be in a perpetual dance of   push and pull with fate and destiny , while watch   I always get the mental image of puppet dangle on string pull by a kind of sadistic puppet master ; what make the drama interesting be the gradual growth and self awareness of the character which allow each one to make some decision which do not appear to be orchestrate by the \\' puppet master\\' . there be a strong sense of do good deed and be kind , especially with regard to goblin , and also with goblin \\'s bride when she make the ultimate sacrifice . I get the sense that this \\' goodness \\' eventually positively impact their destiny . I love the casting , especially with regard to the goblin , the grim reaper and sunny . whenever these three be on screen , together or individually , it be absolute magic!i\\'m sure I do n\\'t need to expound on the genius that be Gong Yoo , he have an uncanny ability to portray his character so sympathetically , realistically and humanly ; he imbue goblin with such pathos , simultaneously make goblin vulnerable , eternally sad yet strong and hopeful all at the same time , he be truly gifted as an actor . the grim reaper be an absolute revelation , Lee Dong Wook take this character to level that I feel only he could take it , he seemed make for this role . his sadness be less hopeful than goblin \\'s , he be always resign to his unhappy fate , while be oblivious   at the same time because of his lack of memory . he be the character that show the most emotional growth in the drama . sunny have the appearance of someone without much depth , and yet she turn out to be very perceptive and emotionally intelligent . she seem to already have some knowledge deep down in her psyche even though she be not aware of it in the beginning . she be complex and many layered . Eun Tak portray her youth in a cute , bubbly manner and she be a ray of light for the other character . she do portray some maturity at the end of the drama but I be never really convinced as I keep see the school girl in she . the story of the goblin and the goblin \\'s bride be a beautiful concept , Gong Yoo play his role to perfection but in my opinion the writing of the goblin \\'s bride as a young girl really throw I off and I be never able to see the two of they as   a convincing romantic pairing . I keep wonder why the goblin \\'s bride could n\\'t be the same age group as sunny , write she as a young girl do n\\'t serve any dramatic purpose and actually take away from the feeling of intense fate love that they be suppose to portray . sunny and the grim reaper on the other hand be very well match , their trajectory be realistic , mature and deeply feel . the fact that their story be so slow in progressing actually add to the depth of their storyline and I find myself wish they have more screen time . the goblin and the grim reaper have one of the good bromance I \\'ve see in a long time , their interaction be entertaining , usually goofy and yet still manage to convey their grow strong bond of friendship in a very believable way . I really enjoy see they together , especially when they team up to achieve a common goal . special mention to Deok Hwa for his perfect comedic timing and refreshing \\' irritating little brother vibe\\'so overall , I highly recommend this drama , it might seem to drag and go around in circle in some place , but it be definitely well worth the watch . PS : all the cast have a prodigious amount of beautiful coats!With its interesting plot line and side story , stellar acting , lovable character , soulful ost , amazing cinematography and the evident hard work put into it by the staff and the writer , this drama deserve all the hype and high rating it continue to get till this date . this drama have an eternal , ethereal beauty to it . the final scene be warm and happy and sweet . from the story to the cinematography , character to their relationship everything have this unique , exquisite , attractive feel to it . the character be so well write , especially Ji Eun Tak/ Goblin \\'s bride ( I know many people find she annoying but she be one of the well depict mortal character in here , I think deeply about her character and she turn out to be the good out there )   and of course , Kim Shin . the ost be exceptional and soulful .   I literally know each and every soundtrack by heart . this drama might have be slow pace , I do n\\'t know for this be my first drama , but the entire time be dedicate to the development of the character and their story . the acting be extraordinary . the lead actor , along with support actor , be exceptional in portray their role . I literally ship Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun and Lee Dong Wook and Yoo in Na ( even Yook Sungjae and his credit card!!)what I really love in this drama be that the character and their story be interconnect for a relevant reason . the love story be tragic yet beautiful . I personally adore Kim Shin and Eun Tak \\'s chemistry and story and they . I be entrance by their story and chemistry . the story of Kim Sun and Wang Yeo be also sweet . the bromance between Kim Shin , Wang Yeo and Yoo Deok Hwa ( mostly the former two ) be exceptionally funny . this drama be perfect in its imperfection . the way it end be the only way I know it could have end . I expect myself re - watch it by the end of 2026 ( I want it to be something special to I ) .   all I know be that I would n\\'t have get interested in k - drama if not for this . it be the Perfect k - drama for I . I hope you all shall try watch this drama without have any second thought ( I doubt too if I should watch it but I nevertheless love it).if you be hesitate to watch this , do n\\'t . I do n\\'t think I \\'d cry this much , but the first episode I be . I read a comment recently about a drama that leave you emotional hungover and it say Goblin . I \\'ve hear it be one of the sad drama out there and they be n\\'t lie . it be sad when you watch a character die , but it be bad when you be expect they to die . the entire time watch this , I be like , \" I know , Kim Shin be go to have to die . \" but the way he do make it the most painful . this drama be one of my favorite now , of all time . the quote , \" I hear we have four life ... \" ugh . that get I every time . to I there be some predictability to this , but I love be able to guess what be gon na happen to both of they . and the ending . I think it be go to end with he   die , but what happen just make my life so much well . I love this entire show and will rewatch this in the future . I need to go cry some more . I do n\\'t know who I be after this . this be just an astonishing and breath take drama .   the actor , oh the actor they make this drama into a marvelous   work of art that I will enjoy over and over again .   the story - line and plot stay on point while the comedy alone come at the time and place .   I be so glad that I give this drama a chance , it introduce I to some great new actor and remind I why I love Gong Yoo so much , that man can act and his facial expression be hilarious , when he cry you just   want to rock and hold he until he feel well .   this drama introduce I to Lee Dong- wook , Jung Hae -in and Yook Sung - jae .   do n\\'t get I wrong I enjoy the female actress in this show but the comedy from the male actor make it even well . I have delay write this review , since I be so excited to see it that I want it to slow down a bit and understand why I like it so much .   I admit that I see it because many people compare the King with this series since it be the same writer , and yes , it have similar thing , which I understand why they compare , but it have nothing to do with the story , I assume that from now on I will see more of this lady \\'s story , since I love what she write , hahaha . although I do n\\'t like Herederos , not everything be perfect . I think she get well with time . now I will talk about Gong Yoo , it be the first time I see he act , and I fall in love with his performance , with his smile , with his eye , the truth be that this man have something deep , add to this interesting character , you really fall in love . you believe everything he express , that be why this character be so special because he make it special . and well , then you put he together with Lee Dong Wook and you laugh out loud . what a great couple these two make . Kim Go Eun , I love she , if I hesitate for a second with her role in the King , this other one confirm that she be good , she act very differently , when she smile like a little girl , I say to myself , she be the same as in the King ? two totally opposite people . I like all the character , I like how they manage to show little , to give depth to each one . although the character that I find difficult to understand be sunny , in the end I be totally move by her beautiful love story . I do n\\'t want to tell a spoiler , because it would be very difficult for I to do it and for they to understand it well , since the way it be tell be very interesting and difficult to put it together by myself . that be why I like it so much and I be sure I \\'ll see it again . a complex story , with so many unexpected turn . go from drama to comedy , cry and then be laugh at . you get so involved that it be as if you be part of the family . you almost swear you have a room in that beautiful house where they live . that be why this series be unforgettable .   100 % recommend . if you \\'ve never see a K - Drama , Goblin would be paradoxically the good and bad one to begin with , depend on your perspective . since it be definitely one of the good K - Dramas to have ever be produce , if it turn out to be your first experience with they , you \\'ll invariably enjoy it ; and likely look for more that be equally as good . unfortunately , if you be expose to a K - drama of this high quality , you may feel let - down by some of the other K - Dramas that you come across , despite how good they may actually be . let \\'s be clear ! while everyone have their favourite K - Dramas , that do n\\'t mean that you wo n\\'t find other to be just as good , or very close , thereafter . some K - Dramas just leap out from the screen and scream high quality at your face . some example are:- Goblin : the lonely and beautiful God- Hotel Del Luna- the scholar who walk the NightYes ! these be head and shoulder above anything that come before they ; however , even K - Dramas that rank 10th , or 20th behind they ( in their respective year ) be still far superior than the crap that gets churn out in Hollywood . with Goblin , you \\'ll be enchant by the actor ( both lead and secondary ) ; lull in by the beauty of the musical score ( original music for most non - Koreans , for sure ) ; and blow away at the originality of the story . keep in mind that Hollywood be struggle to find any original idea ; and even their television show be essentially a remake , re - imagine , or blatant rip - off of something that have come before it . with K - Dramas , you might find that some be loosely base on chinese , japanese , or even korean mythology , or historical fiction , it be do with a completely fresh mentality . I\\'ve watch Goblin a few time ; and each time , I \\'ve discover something new . it be so beautiful to watch the story unfold . you \\'ll find yourself fall in love with the character ; and wish that you would dive in and intervene . it be so easy to be draw into the story by the quality of acting , as well as the production value , that you \\'ll be hard - press not to be emotionally invest in every scene . personally , I find myself fall in love with one character ; wish that I could help other character ; lust for another character ; loathe another character ; pity many character ; and generally feel like so many other character be my own personal friend and acquaintance . ( that last be difficult for I to explain , further)If you do n\\'t come away from Goblin without first be take on an emotional roller coaster , then you be either not human , or you K - Dramas just might not be your thing . if that be the case , do n\\'t give up right away . maybe the other two series that I \\'ve mention above , will blow smoke up your skirt . then again , maybe you just need to consider a different genre of K - Drama . keep in mind that they truly run the gambit of genre : romance ; Supernatural ; Comedy ; thriller ; mystery ; etc ... you be literally guarantee to find something that you like . i\\'d like to add that regardless of the K - drama genre , korean director / producer have discover the formula for make average , or less than average look actor / actress look absolutely stunning ... beautiful ... cute ... etc ... whatever it be , I like it . in fact , in retrospect , I \\'ve learn through K - Dramas that many of the girl from my past be more appealing to I than I realize at the time . ( no ! I be not go to expound upon that . lol ! suffice to say , as you get old , you get wise ... and hopefully , more realistic about life.)this show have so may feel happy sad scared emotional . either way it be a great \\xa0 show . the whole cast do great from begin to end . Gong yoo and lee dong wook oppa tog in one show be daebak . I love they individually . new girl kim go eun capture I from her drama cheese in the trap . she have a very natural innocent believable act one ca nt say that she s actually in character . Yoo in na on the other hand be a beauty and her character be very important for the show . Yook sungjae who play duk hwa do a tremendous job with his innocence and weirdness which add laughter to the show . Goblin and grim reaper be perfect and their bromance be ship worthy . \\xa0 must see . I would probably watch again . I be have goblin withdrawal . \\xa0 I think I \\'ll visit canada to the film location . here be a summary . \\xa0  * * * Overseas film ] Quebec , Canada . Petit - Champlain District . Chateau Frontenac Hotel . Parc du Bastion - de - la - reine ( Green pasture with the Tombstones ( prop ) ) Fontaine de Tourny . Rue Sainte - Ursule . Parc Samuel - Hollande ( Gong Yoo catch the fall maple leaf ) Porte Prescott ( bridge that Eun Tak walked)*****Back in college , I get addict in Korean / Taiwanese / chinese tv series because of Meteor Garden . then , I just stop watch altogether because I focus on US tv series . when I ask my friend for recommendation when I get interested again in watch korean tv series , this come highly recommend . if you be not fan historical setting / adaptation in a series , the first episode might discourage you which happen to I . after watch the first episode , it take I two day before watch the second episode and I got hook ever since!i love the story line . very refreshing and unique which attract I most and keep I hook all throughout . the cast be amazing ! even the support one . watch out for sunny ? ? ? ? . she will steal your heart with her wit and charm ! there be too many funny scene which add spice to the show . and when tragedy hit , it really make I cry . it also make I think about afterlife and reincarnation . although ending be expect , I still love how it turn out . even the music be on the spot ! I ’ve download the music / OST relate to this show . overall , if you want to deviate from the usual romcom plot , I highly recommend this series . it will keep you smile and laugh . dramatic part will hit you hard and be do tastefully . I love even the place where they shoot it especially the beach , buckwheat field and the tea house ! I would n’t hesitate to watch it over and over again!STORY : well , the story itself be really good , I mean there be a few plot hole I do n\\'t understand   but what I like with this be drama be the supernatural / fantasy element , I be such a sucker for those type of genre . it also help that the cinematography be really beautiful , I absolutely love it!acting / casting : well , I think one of the reason why this show be a success be most def because of Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook , their bromance be more romantic than their female lead , and their dynamic be superb , not to mention the acting and the comedic scene this two make , hahha!MUSIC : one of the highlight of this show be their music - it be soooo on point- I have every song on my phone to listen to from time to time . it also show that the music be effective because whenever I think of sunny and Grimreaper the song that automatically play on my mind be I miss you by Soyou ( this song be my favorite ) or if the bride and the goblin it always be ( Beautiful Life or I will come to you like the first snow ) that be how beautiful the OST of this drama is!REWATCH value : I would def rewatch this show again just because I love the interaction between Lee Dong Wook and Gong Yoo hahahhahaOVERALL : this be a great watch indeed , I be just glad I wait week for this show to finish before I watch it because damn I would have pull my hair out wait for the damn episode every week!!!This be one of the good drama I have watch in my life and I be talk about and I be talk about one of the good american , korean , japanese and chinese drama . the scenery be so beautiful in some scene that I think korean tourism improve because of this drama . again , this drama touch one of those challenging taboo in society - a high school poor kid fall in love with a powerful rich man   way old than she . in any other circumstance , this point of view be highly controversial , but since this be a Goblin we be talk about , our moral value surrender and go along with the story line . I love the line on Gong Yoo \\'s face . especially when he smile - weather line .... so majestically handsome . the OST be just so so amazing .   I would watch this drama over and over again just to listen some of the song with its matching scene . breathtakingly script and capture on screen .   must watch!there be a period that I stop watch because Eun Tak \\'s personality be unbearable , or her relationship with Kim Shin feel really force and unnatural . only towards the end do I begin to truly feel the impact that the two have make on each other , but maybe that be because all the actor start to cry in , like , every scene lol . the arc with Park Woo Joon be really scary , because I quite literally ca n\\'t stand any thriller , horror , or any deceased makeup lmao and turn the humorous - lightheartedness of the drama immediately into something dark . there be much more action in the last 4 - 5 episode than the long buildup in the first 12 episode , but you eventually understand what all those little moment mean in the end , which I guess be sort of rewarding . in the end , my thought be sort of jumbled because the world do n\\'t seem to have order . many thing happen that just do n\\'t make sense accord to information give or reveal beforehand . the last episode , especially , be really unbelievable because of what Goblin say about have the same face . ultimately , I think the acting , humor , and touch aspect of Goblin be well do ( also every person in this drama --except Park Woo Joon ew-- be very beautiful ) but the development and execution of the story be not very well do . I watch this show because 1 ) my friend recommend it as it be his first kdrama , 2 ) it receive critical claim after its release , and 3 ) GONG YOO , and I be glad I do for those reason . there be some scene that be very , very quick , but for some reason it pull on my heart and begin to cry . those moment , though , be never central to the main plot line and that may have be the problem . basically , this drama be n\\'t fantastic per say and keep that in mind if you decide to watch.**one last thing : the soundtrack be alright , but not impressive to other OST music I \\'ve hear . my favorite be \" I miss you \" but the other do n\\'t really draw any emotion from I ? perhaps that be because my favorite drama right now be Scarlet Heart Ryeo and I fall in love so hard with both the drama and the music that I come into Goblin with the bar raise too high . story : story be beautiful . each scene either have I in fierce rage , cry like a child , giggle like a school girl or in absolute shock & in disbelief . it do not end the way I expect it to , but I still love the ending even though it seem like there be a few unanswered question . at time I be confused ( idk if this be due to my slowness ) , but soon the gap be slowly fill . each character have their own time to shine and I love the short scene that be give to minor character to tell their own small story of their struggle and hardship such as the one in the beginning of that little boy who be adopt into a european family . the first thing that get I hooked onto this drama be not only the concept and theme of it , but also the first episode , which I do n\\'t expect to tear out my heart straight away and leave I with heartbreak . although I would have like their age gap to have be a bit small at first , I realize in due time that it would not have work with the story line if it be . therefore , it be okay for I . the whole plot be neither too rush nor too slow for I . everything be time perfectly and the Goblin and the Goblin \\'s bride \\'s romance progress well . overall , I find the story and plot amazing ! I take off 0.5 because towards the last couple of episode , the Grim Reaper keep silently tear / cry a little too much for my like lol . ( yes , I know it be because of all the hardship he be struggle through , but still).ACTING / CAST : nothing much need to be say about their acting and cast . everything about it be perfect .... flawless ! each play out their character extremely well and each of they be able to tug at your heartstring with each of their crying scene ! let \\'s just say , I cry with they at a few of these scene . each character have beautiful chemistry ; especially the chemistry between the Goblin and Ji Euk Tak . Gong Yoo ( Goblin ) be honestly so damn handsome and ahem ... hot , and his smile be so adorable ! and Lee Dong Wook ( grim reaper ) be so beautiful he catch I off guard sometimes . Kim Go Eun ( Ji Eun Tak ) be such an adorable girl . I ca n\\'t believe she be 26 when she look like an actual high schooler . when she mature in the drama , she become so beautiful when all she do be change her hair and outfits , and a little bit of her makeup . Yoo In - na ( sunny ) be beautiful to I from the beginning til the end ! she look so young for a 35yo too . Yook Sungjae ( Deok Hwa ) be hilarious and I love how lose he look half the time . I first know he as a BTOB member so I know how weird and funny he be in reality . so his acting catch I off guard a few time since this be my first time see his acting and I notice how amazing he really be , especially during those serious moment like the one in ep 12 when they be at a bar . music : in my opinion , Goblin have the good music and OST \\'s . my favorite be probably Crush \\'s beautiful , Ailee \\'s I will go to you like the First Snow , Sam Kim \\'s who be you , and Chanyeol and Punch \\'s stay with I . each song be play at perfect moment which suit the scene . when you think the scene be heartbreaking enough , the song that play will make that heartbreak even bad . I do n\\'t get sick of any of the OST \\'s that play as I usually do with a few other drama . so if you be a sucker for good , beautiful OST \\'s , this drama be for you!REWATCH value : okay first off , I give the rewatch value a 9.5 because I do n\\'t fully know if I would be able to   go through all that heartbreak again because I honestly almost could n\\'t take it at a few point . other than that , I would \\'ve give it a 10 . I would rewatch it for the funny moment and amazing plot , as well as for the romantic moment between the character . overall : I put off finish the drama when I finish until ep 11 , not because it be n\\'t good but because the story of the character be go so well and everyone seem so happy . and I know it be go to go downhill from there and the past be go to catch up to they soon or later .   this drama be absolutely flawless . it be hilarious and I love the bromance relationship between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper ! love their little antic . I regret put this drama off for so long but I do not regret watch it and finish it off in one day one bit . I know this drama be an amazing drama because after I finish it , I no long know what to do with my life . I really , really want to love this show . the tone in the beginning be intriguing , the comedy / drama be well - balanced and fun , and the story be so engaging . but there be so much waste potential . Shin \\'s story be tragic and emotional , and I be deeply move by his character , which be why I be not rate low . yet the focus on the \" fated \" romance and the fact that it start when she be so young just bother I . you ca n\\'t tell I that these people be mean for each other just because they be fate ; show I , let I feel their connection . I do n\\'t , and that be where this fall flat for I . story : all over the place . too many interweave character storyline and relationship fight for center stage , too many repeat scene , and truly atrocious pacing . I could n\\'t stand how slowly this move , honestly . it feel like it start out strongly , but then character would spend episode do nothing . they would talk , they would be cute , they would be unsure , but nothing really happen for so . many . episode . and then when something finally do happen that bring the character into conflict , it be too quick to feel at all developed . in particular , an antagonist pop up later in the series and when they deal with they , I be leave think , \" ... that be it ? that be how they be gon na do this?\"the character be okay , but Eun Tak be just ... not very well - develop , in my opinion . she be a bubbly , optimistic girl who can see ghost and want to help people . okay , why ? why do she cling to Shin strongly at the beginning , and be I suppose to be charm by the fact that an immature teenager be flirt with a 1,000 year old man ? there be n\\'t much depth to she or their romance , and I feel disconnected from her character as a whole . which far make the romance less engaging to I . furthermore , so many of these character have the potential to be amazing , with just a little more focus and development , which I think be sacrifice in order to fit so many of the other element into the show . act : I do like the cast , especially Gong Yoo . I be also incredibly impressed with Lee Dong Wook as I \\'ve think he be a bad actor in the past , yet his work here definitely make I second guess my opinion of he . Kim Go Eun be a really good actress , yet see she play an immature teenager for so much of the show really grate on my nerve . but , boy , can she cry . both she and Gong Yoo can make your heart ache , I \\'ll give they that . never be a huge fan of Yoo in Na , but she do well here , so I do n\\'t mind she . music : cute , fitting . I do n\\'t remember most of it , but I be go to attribute that to the fact that I be consistently frustrate with the show . I can tell you that this be an OST that will definitely stay with the people who love the show , though . TL;DR : I be glad that this show have bring such joy to so many people , but it disappoint I . I should have know well consider how I \\'ve fare with Kim Eun Sook \\'s other drama , but I be hope this one be different . however , if you like her other drama and be a fan of fantasy , fate lover , a little bit of sadness , a little bit of comedy , and a whole lot of romance , then definitely give this one a shot . I really enjoy the storyline portray in this drama . usually , the more a drama can make I react vocally - shout , scream , cry , wail , etc . - the high I will rate it . it sound silly , I know , but if a show can provoke that kind of response from I , there be something to be say about it . this show have I enthral from the first to the last episode . it be like a really good book ; I could n\\'t stop watch ! I laugh and cry a lot.honestly , this be one of a handful of drama I have see that be go on my list of \\' rewatche \\' . yes , I feel it be that . good . my rule of watch a drama be that I have to wait for the drama to air finish then I will start to watch cos I really hate to wait . especially if the story be nice , the wait period be a hell for I . before I start watch Goblin , the \\' stir \\' of this drama be so big that coll , friend and medium be all talk about it . I start watch Goblin with very high expectation but yet , it still surprise I and it just totally blow my mind .. the story be just so beautiful and too beautiful . the heart - ache part be so heart wrench that I still have tear in my eye after watch 3 time . I will skip the review on the acting as the acting be just perfect . each character just fit on the role perfectly . the comedy in the drama be n\\'t a lot but the comedy content be very new . how to say .. the comedy in this drama be more of cute and relax style . the comedy write in this drama be n\\'t find in other drama before . everything just very ..... match . Goblin totally shake the world of drama a big time . I believe this will be a start for \\' Goblin \\' alike story come soon . if you be a kdrama fan , this drama be a must WATCH.•I be search for a new drama and on the home page of MDL I see the top 10 drama list , I think of complete that entire list as many of they I have already watch . so I start with Goblin the lonely and great god . as soon as I start it I be stuck and intrigue by its amazing tale.•the historic era with a goryeo warrior be an amazing start with all the supernatural element perfectly blend . the bromance more than romance be total mindblaster with all those quick and witty situation I have my stomach ache laugh immensely.•this tale be perfect , for I its flawless . I always think that for kdrama the lead shoud be handsome and beautiful , this drama break my pretty boy syndrome . Gong Yoo outshine as dukkebi and I become a fan of he . his acting be just awesome . as for kim go eun , I have watch she in cheese in the trap where she play a university student be excellent but here as a high - schooler it leave I with speechless . she look like a high - schooler . I do nt understand what kind of makeup the artist do that they actually give you a young feel . Lee Dong Wook ! ! ! ouch he be real masterpiece . his eye be more speakable , splendid acting and expression . and his chemistry with yoo in na be very nice . next be gon na watch theirs touch your heart.•Ost be nice especially stay with me.• as for rewatch I already have watch it thrice . for my first ever drama review , I want it to be a review for Goblin . personally , Goblin be an amazing journey for I . when I watch the first episode , I feel like wake up from a sleep I do n\\'t know I be in . to some , it be overrate . and , yes , maybe it be . but it be the kind of drama that you need to experience before dwell into other genre . I feel a personal connection to all the character and to the story itself . it have great production value and an amazing cast . storythe storyline of Goblin be simple , but throughout the episode , you get to see different aspect of it . it branch out in a lot of way , but stay the same until the end . scene from the past get repeat a bit too much , but I feel it be necessary because each time they bring some new emotion and even parallel with scene in the present time . story of the past tie nicely with the present ( and eventually future ) . the show do n\\'t leave you confused and , although it be in time predictable , leave you want to know why certain thing happen . act / CASTA set of amazing actor who portray their character so well that you will laugh with they , cry with they and even be agitate by the same thing as they be . Gong Yoo be without a doubt perfect for this show as be Lee Dong Wook , Kim Go Eun and Yoo in Na . other in support role be great as well . all secondary character actually have interesting backstorie that go well with the main story . MUSICThe OST be simply amazing . one of the good soundtrack I \\'ve ever hear . each song be beautiful and appropriate for each scene . I find myself play the OST on repeat a lot . music be always a big part of show and here it really emphasize all the emotion . ( sometimes you hear a specific song and you just know what be about to happen - you will either cry or die of laughter.)OVERALLI will most definitely rewatch Goblin . tbh , it be my favorite drama of all time ( probably because it be my first ) . honestly , with the writing and the production value , it be no wonder Goblin be a fan favorite . it really touch I and open my eye to so many thing . it often leave I laugh and cry at the same time which no show so far have do for I . definitely recommend to everyone , even though it might not be everyone \\'s cup of tea . for I , it be n\\'t just a cup , it be a whole bowl of tea . I remember when I watch this drama for the first time , it be still ongoing . I look forward to each episode with great enthusiasm . I be so curious about the continuation of the story . when this drama end , there be a sense of loss in I , to the point that I could n\\'t watch other drama for a while . this drama have make a deep impression on I , and I ca n\\'t find any drama like this again , at least until I write this review . I love every episode in this drama . it be so good from the start to the end . the story go really well . it seem that the writer know where the story be go and consistently follow it . the next important part that also make this drama memorable be the character . they all leave impression on I , even the extra . every character be just right , portray by the right actor too . the chemistry between the lead be one of the good I can find in kdrama . the production of this drama be also no joke . the production team really give the good they could for this drama . the cinematography be breath take , and the soundtrack be just so good . I even still play the soundtrack regularly and it still give I the feel . I just want to thank the writer , director , actor and production crew for this masterpiece . I do n\\'t have enough word to describe how much I love this drama ! it make I laugh , cry and get so invest in the character . I be that addicted to this drama that I look forward to the new episode every week and between they I would read all the recap available online . : PI really love the fantasy / supernatural themed drama and think this story be very unique feature reincarnation , grim reaper , goblin , demigod etc it be very in depth . my only gripe and it be a very small one ... be that I find the romance unsatisfying for I . Ji Un Tak seem so young to I compare to Kim shin that I almost feel uncomfortable . also Ji Un Tak seem a bit immature even though she have so many hardship . the bromance relationship definitely interest I more than the romance , Kim shim and the grim reaper just have such a fun relationship and be so similar it be great . the cast be of course A - M - A - z - I - n - g especially with Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook . this be now one of my all - time fave , why be you read this ? go watch this drama now ! you owe it to yourself :) the premise of the show be interesting .   the show center around the grow and tragic relationship between a high school student and a 900 something year old warrior turn Goblin ( Korean Goblin ) . the execution down the line be flawed like they be write the plot while they be film . do they really have to make Ji Eun - tak ( Kim Go - eun ) a high school student ? no , but I guess they want to get that demographic .   she be fate to be the \" Goblin \\'s wife \" . the relationship eventually turn romantic . the show gloss over the extreme age difference between the two and the Goblin ( Gong Yoo ) certainly do n\\'t look or act ( most of the time ) like 900 . I find Ji Eun - tak to be very charming and the weakness to her character could be attribute to the forced writing . the romance between the two be very forced but when the tragedy hit , the two main actor be very good at convey sadness . Gong Yoo be good comedic actor and the Goblin get \\'s rile up comedically due to the new people he meet after his long life . another large plot element involve the Grim Reapers . the main grim reaper ( Lee Dong - wook )   be put into close contact through fate with the goblin and the high schooler . he start off as a cold and stoic character . there be scene intersperse throughout the series of GR send off lose soul to their next destination . I find most of these scene to be touching . also , most of the funny scene involve he and the Goblin . past life and reincarnation play a big part in the story .   we slowly see the tragic past of the Goblin and what event lead he to live a long unaging life . the Grim Reapers be once human who have commit horrible sin while they live and they work in death with their memory wipe of their past life . Main GR \\'s past life seem to be connect with the Goblin \\'s life before the Goblin be curse / bless with immortality . unfortunately , we have the cliched Kdrama push and pull , and initial denial of feeling that plague even the well romantic drama .   I never really get why the two main would fall in love , but once the plot move past that point , the main have good chemistry together .   Tragedy come at the hand of God ( literally ) . it be not really explain well why the god want these character to not come together or die or whatever . the finale be a mess but it rely on the audience to follow it base on tragic emotion . all in all it be a fun time but think back on it make the flaw glare out . I like this show .   I come to care most for its character because the actor make they lovable , unlike the story itself , which be sloppy and muddled in its lore . this be a fantasy romance , which be usually up my alley .   however , this one could have be well have the story stick to its own rule .   what ensue be quite a lot of plot hole and overly dramatic performance .   I suppose the writer be hope you will overlook its many flaw and focus on the romance between our mc .   that be fine for some .   I like my drama to be a little well think out and organize . a lot be go on here .   we have a young , high school age girl who be lonely and look to belong .   we have a god / guardian who have be live in immortality since a tragedy cause he to be what he be .   he be search for his bride as she will have the power to end his long existence and give he peace .   enter grim reaper with complicated backstorie and god play with human life , and the story become a complicated mess because it do n\\'t stick to its own rule .   some thing be never really explain and it leave you with a lot of question .   above all this , it be still highly entertaining and I be a sucker for a good romance , even though the first episode exasperate I to no end .   our   goblin like to play game with the girl and their silly banter run the gamut from idiocy to deep tenderness , once the nonsense between they be clear away and Mr. Goblin realize he be in love , what make this drama watchable despite its flaw be the beautiful actor that make up this ensemble .   they be wholly believable , in the moment and completely invest in their character .   no one do this well than Gong Yoo , our handsome goblin .   his expressive eye make you feel every emotion emanate from within .   his despair be our despair , his joy make we feel warm .   ( because of this ability to give himself completely to his role , Gong Yoo have win the top spot in my list of good actor in South Korea .   he be also , in my opinion , the most breathtakingly beautiful man I have ever set eye on . )    there be some downright hilarious moment and clear message of friendship , compassion , loyalty and forgiveness .   the soundtrack be amazing .   the song range from typical pop piece to some very different sound which fit the drama perfectly .   I would watch this again just to relive the dreamy spark of Gong Yoo \\'s eye . Goblin have nearly a perfect story and feature superb acting talent .   Kim Go Eun , Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook all have amazing performance .   though Kim Go Eun and Gong Yoo illustrate such chemistry through the series , it have to be say that Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook \\'s bromance steal the show .   man , the fan service ! ! this drama have become one of my favorite . I ca n\\'t lie I start watch this drama for the cast and do n\\'t really know what the story be go to about but I be so happy I watch it . the chemistry betythe actor be amazing and the story have I hook from the first episode all the way to the end .   this be a story about love but not just romantic love but love of friendship and family . this drama have moment that will have you laugh and moment when it will have you in tear . this be over all one of the good drama I \\'ve watch in a while . finally it be the finale !   I have be wait for the finale just for I to see what will really happen although at the back of my mind I know it already !   I would say I have a mixed impression on the finale and the total drama itself .   one thing for sure this drama have capture the heart of many kdrama viewer .   it have the perfect production value , cinematography , writing and character development !   the acting of everybody be just excellent !   I salute especially Kim Go Eun as Ji - Eun Tak the bride of the Goblin .   her acting be fantastic , controlled and natural .   she have mature dramatically from the last time I watch she in cheese in the Trap .   and she be just young and yet she can act incredibly good !   Gong Yoo , Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In - ha   also do a remarkable acting performance . let we go to the story .   it have one of the most uniquely write story !   every plot make sense !   the writer successfully make an attempt to inject many light hearted scene to balance off the very serious theme of the drama .   and this be what that mix impression that I be say .   this be very sad story , bittersweet and depressing !   even tough we get a happy ending ( opps possible spoiler here ) it be still not a happy ending at all !   because we know that Goblin be an immortal being and after the life of the bride , Goblin stay behind and still feel sad and lonely ! he will still be a wanderer alone and it hurt I to think that until when will he be live ? but the central theme be the selling point of this drama ,   that love will see you through beyond the border of eternity !   I just want to say this , and perhaps I belong to the minority , I ca nt really see the connection between the lead !   I do nt see any romance maybe because I see they as sibling perhaps or just an uncle - niece relationship !   blame the age gap of the lead !   I just ca nt seem to connect with they as well . the music be incredibly amazing !   I love how they be put in the drama !   it give the fantasy feel !   I like most of they . because of its depressing tone I will only do selective rewatching like the bromance scene of the 2 lead actors!Overall , this be highly recommend drama .   good acting , story and script !   Worth my 16 hour of view . first of all , I would like to say thank you for make this korean drama . let I say the good thing first:1 . I love their act on the sad scene , I mean , they make I move and cry.2 . the music be perfect because it really fit in specific scene . the background music add that tension , depressed and happy feeling . if the scene make I cry , the add background music make I cry more.3 . I think the plot be good :) the bromance be good too . now the not - so - good things:1 . there be some part that I do n\\'t feel the romantic connection between the Goblin and the High School Girl . I do n\\'t know why , but I just do n\\'t feel it ( I even love the connection between the Grim Reaper and the Chicken Restaurant Owner than the 2 lead ) , but during the middle till the end ( especially when the lead girl character be 29 y / o ) , I be feel their connection and I like it.2 . I do n\\'t like the thing where they add something ( like a recap ) on some episode that make it damn long , I even have to skip it , sorry but I be an impatient person.3 . I love the sad scene more than some scene , because in some scene , I got bore a little bit ( I use my phone during the boring scene , which mean that I really get bored ) . I be not interested ( a bit ) on the flashback ( idk why , sorry d : ) my rewatch value be 7 because I could watch it again , but I be that type of person who do n\\'t want to watch depressing scene again because I do n\\'t want to cry a lot . overall , I think the drama be great ! I can not count how many time I cry in just this drama .. probably 30 or 40 lol . because most of the scene really make I cry . well what can I say that have n\\'t already be say by many people before I . I be blow away by this drama . I do n\\'t want this show to end and wish it could \\'ve carry on and on because I love the story . every episode in some way or another bring I to tear ( maybe I be just an overly emotional person though ) . the music , acting / cast , cinematography and writing be so on point and beautifully portray . this have now become one of my all time favourite drama . I look forward to rewatche this with my mum as I know she will love it . I like everything about this drama . the cast really fit and blend well together and the emotional scene be so believable . I \\'ve not see any of their previous work and I be now excited to watch their other drama . I would recommend this to anyone who ( like I ) enjoy a mix of romance , fantasy & supernatural element . I apologise if this review be all over the place . it be my first time write one on here and I do n\\'t quite know what to say other than this drama be simply beautiful!Enjoy!I start watch this drama because of the talented writer and Lee Dong Wook , and not because it be a \" hit \" , and I \\'ve like it ever since the first episode . the story feel \" new \" in term of K - Drama , because not all fantasy project be craft well , but it be a classic plot re - imagine in a different way , so nothing really new . it be a simple story twist in different way all over again . yes , this be how a writer work , but what I once think would turn out to be something unpredictable , have turn to be a plot I have already see in the drama itself . let I explain : the story be simple and ever since the beginning the audience know what be to come , the problem be how to \" solve \" the main issue without end the show how you expect it . in a way , the writer manage to do that , but on another side , she do n\\'t , because even as I follow the show while it be on - air , I predict long ago what would happen . perhaps having read so many fantasy book influence I , that be what I want to think . in my mind I keep say \" please do n\\'t go to that route and surprise I \" but I be disappoint in the last episode because some plot and character be introduce too late or not give the space they deserve , as if the writer think about their fate too late and there be n\\'t time to fix that . while the mix between historical drama flashback and present time fill with the cute moment between the main couple and the other character and the bromance between Goblin and Grim Reaper be comic , I feel as if the writer spend more time on the banter than on the actual plot , and some episode feel like a filler , especially the last 3 . but overall , it be an enjoyable story . have both my favorite actor Lee Dong Wook and Gong Yoo ( this be the 1st drama I watch with he in it ) as the male lead - because as Kim Eun Sook prove in her other drama , she can give enough screentime to more than one actor - be a pleasant experience . they have great chemistry , their bromance be awesome and it sometimes overshadow the main couple . I live for their bickering , they bring I to tear and this do n\\'t happen much . needless to say their acting be great . I love LDW as the Grim Reaper and he move I a lot , he be really fit to play a serious and a bit depressed immortal angel of death . Gong Yoo be also a surprise , since this be my first drama with he . I feel like he bring peace o the set , I do n\\'t know . he give I the aura of a heartwarming person . I be a bit tear about Kim Go Eun . she be believable as a 19 year old even though sometimes she use too much aegyo . ok that she be still a teen , but tone it down a bit , gurl . like I say , her chemistry with Gong Yoo be there but there be time I do n\\'t feel as much for Goblin / Eun Tak couple as I do for Goblin / grim Reaper . perhaps it be the age gap that make they give the feel of dad - daughter or oppa - dongsaeng , because it depend on the moment . Eun Tak could go to 19 year old to wise girl in a heartbeat and the Goblin could act like a small child one moment and like a mature guy the next . overall , though , they be balance in my opinion . and I like that in many moment in the second half of the drama where they have to film kiss or couple - y scene , they seem very comfortable acting as a couple . Yoo in Na be perfect as a beautiful BBQ shop owner . she be witty and funny and I love her sense of fashion . I also like Yook Sung Jae as Deok Hwa . the music be great , you can tell they spend a nice deal of money and time to make it good . in general , I would say that this drama be for fantasy lover the most with a side of romantic comedy . if you be look for something mysterious , there be few question you be gon na ask yourself indeed , but be not complicated like a melo . let \\'s just say , the story be simple and the message the author want to convey be too . my only reason for not put a 10/10 rating be that no show be perfect , though as far as kdrama go , this one be very well - conceive and well - execute . I agree with criticism regard the slow pacing of the plot ( particularly from episode 5 - 7 ) and excessive product placement , but besides all of that , \" Goblin \" be able to deliver a refreshing plot back up by a+ act , masterful directing and cinematography , and wonderful ost , that these shortcoming barely become bothersome at all . congratulation to Kim Eun Sook for finally write something that deserve all the hype ( contrary to popular opinion , I do n\\'t find her previous hit as compelling and deserving , but that be just I ) . the plot need some more polishing but overall be cohesive , profound and compelling . a show that you will definitely watch more than once , just to catch the subtle clue and foreshadow that you miss when you see it for the first time.5 episodios he durado . Todo en esta serie es tan absurdo que no te motiva a seguir viéndola . Lo mejor la música y los actore , pero no consiguen sostener la lamentable trama . ah , Goblin . the drama with the most insane summary I \\'d read up to that point . amnesiac grim reaper ? Goblin with an invisible sword through his chest ? Goblin \\'s bride who be ... a high school student , which be kinda creepy when you think about it ? ghost ? deity ? Reincarnation?Yeap , all there . but damn , this be well than I ever could \\'ve expect . \" every moment shine . \" in deed . ok , so maybe not * every * moment , but 89 % of they for sure . I cry . I laugh . I want to group - hug the Goblin and the Grim Reaper and have a beer with they . they be friendship goal , level : immortal . sometimes I actually wish there \\'d be more short ark with those two alone , because their interaction be both hilarious and heartwarming . the smartphone scene kill I every time , as do the one where they coolly go out of the tunnel with leek and grocery bag . bromance for the age . Gong Yoo and Lee Dong - wook have the good chemistry out of all male actor I \\'ve see so far . a+.about the love story .. though it be pretty hard for I to get with the program and support the Goblin and Eun - tak relationship at first because it be , frankly , wrong , to my great surprise ( and maybe , a bit of disdain as well ) , I do like how they be write by the end and how their interaction be deal with . I do n\\'t want to be hypocritical , I \\'ve enjoy many a vampire romance in which the difference in term of age be probably great , but Gong Yoo be just so obviously old and the way they dress he ( op.ed . wonderfully ) make he seem super serious . on the other hand , Eun - tak be .. a girl - this characterization be something I struggle with the most , because it both prevent I from root for they from the start , but be also a pretty realistic portrayal of the character , which I appreciate . by the time we get through the age gap though , I be totally on board . well , a bit before that as well , just in time to bawl my eye out to the rooftop scene . her character really strike a chord with I in the end and I wish they \\'d do the jump a bit soon and shuffle the stuff a bit so we could see more of old - Eun - tak \\'s moment with Shin . the story between the Reaper and sunny be hilarious , I love they together and I be super happy that they get the ending they do , both of they . eye - bawl moment # 2 . I especially love sunny \\'s confidence which maybe make she come over as shallow at the start , but when you later realize how much she care about he , and the history they share , it break your heart . the Grim Reaper be definitely my favorite character and that do n\\'t change throughout the series . the deadpan comedic delivery , the whining , his brotherly love for Eun - tak and his \" client \" ... some of the short scene in the tea - room be my favorite part of certain episode , especially the one with the soldier and his sweetheart who be wait for he for 70 + year . overall , the series be wonderfully imaginative , poetic , with beautiful photography and lovable character . it do seem to drag at certain time , but never enough to even consider drop it or put it on hold . the fantasy world create in the show be rich and magical . love , love , LOVE . a must - see . alright , this drama have get to be my one of my top favorite dream for many reason . one , the cinematography of the drama be amazing , the effect use on it to showcase the goblin \\'s power be amazing , whoever be in charge of it deserve a praise . second , the actor \\' and actress \\' performance be stunning , they do an amazing job at perform the emotion in a way that grab the viewer and make they feel like they be actually in the drama . thirdly , the plot be amazing , well - write and execute , could \\'ve have ask for a well plot . it make you think , analyze and create your own theory on the drama . I will say that there be plot twist that you do n\\'t see come at all . I personally truly enjoy the drama , I would rewatch it again with no doubt . I hope that if you be still debate whether to watch it or not you do decide to give this drama a chance , I promise you it wo n\\'t disappoint you.who have nt hear of goblin ? if u r here , then chance r u have already hear of all the hype and the positive stuff about it , time for the other side of the coin review , goblin start out with a fantasy story that be really damn good , first episode take a while so u scroll down to find goblin \\'s episode r actually 90 minute long , okay so that s a fancy sneaky way to advertise a 24 episode show be 16 longish episode , act be great , nearly every actor / actress feel perfect for the role except for the little important main lead actress Kim Go - Eun , she feel so wrong cast on so many level , something just feel off from first time u see she on the screen , 12 year difference between she and gong yoo just add oil to the chemistry on fire already .. , every other single relationship between the character be perfect , the chemistry be just amazing inbetween the rest of the castexecution :   this drama be amazingly execute but it suffer horribly from the most common trend korea do , it drag the heck out , if u think 90 minute can be tolerable at first 5 episode w8 till u reach some filler episode around 12~ holly molly how can there be literally many filler scene in such a drama?overall : this drama be well write , it drag alot , if u can get over that and Kim Go - Eun , its enjoyableAnother one to my special list!What happen when a goblin , and grim reaper become roommate ? if nothing else , you can be sure that there will be lot of roommate drama , bromance , and funny moment ! special mention to the scene where they go out to get grocery like the supernatural being they be , it crack I up . why be this special , you ask : go watch the drama : POn a serious note , Goblin be like a ray of sunshine that flicker through on a cloudy day for I . although it have its flaw ( with respect to pacing and few unresolved question ) , it be beautifully write and portray . the story be build with a rich mythology , fill with element of hilarity , romance and above all melancholy . each of the character , even minor one , have an intriguing charm to they and fulfil a unique purpose in the storyline . Cinematography , especially scene in Quebec , be visually stunning ( I ca nt wait to visit Chateau Frontenac and other place in QC during fall now ) . I also really like listen to the drama \\'s OST , especially beautiful by Crush , and have of course add it to my Kdrama playlist . maybe this might not be a popular opinion but I love the bittersweet touch to its ending . I clearly have a thing for sad love story . but what I take away from the drama the most , be that at the end of the day , we do need to deal with life on our own even with or without the presence of your love one . but , why should that mean , live life unhappily . in fact , live each moment with great joy , share precious moment with your dear one , if not for anything else but to respect the love that you have receive so far . with all the limitation we have as mortal being , you might as well make the most of each moment . I be leave with some question at the end but I be ok ignore these minor flaw as it keep I hooked till the last minute while also be think provoke . now , if only I could summon \" the One \" , by blow on a candle ;) a really great story . romance , tragedy , thrill , everything have be lay out just perfectly . hat off to the cast who play such great character . it completely hard to think that they be just character , and not real people . and what a twist with \" GOD \" . be and atheist myself , it be a really great experience to watch this . I would surely recommend this to people . honestly , this be my entry into the world of asian drama , until now , I just use to watch japanese anime . but , guess , I have drown too deep into drama now . and goblin be the first ever drama I have watch . so this will be something that I will always love and recommend to other . this be honestly one of the good drama \\'s and I say that about cheese in a trap last yearI feel something need a little more time at the endbut other than that love it :) the first time I hear about this drama , I be so excited because I be in love with Gong Yoo after I watch train to Busan and I miss Lee Dong Wook so much ! at the beginning , I could see that this drama have some potential to become a famouse one . and then , BOOM . although this one air on tv cabel only in Korea , this drama get so much attention from KDrama lover . it have high drama rating on the tvN \\'s history so far . it be all smooth at the beginning , I really enjoy it . I think I would fall for the main lead \\' relationship , but nope . I fall for the bromance of the Goblin , grim reaper , and deok hwa bromance instead . they be absolutely entertaining and amazing together ! idk maybe it be just I , I do n\\'t feel satisfied with the ending . the ending be too contrived and too haste for I . I be like .... \" wait , what ? \" \" what ? \" \" uhm okay \" . but overall , I still like this anyway . well , not as much as I love Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo since the story be more relatable , rational , and perfectly end . the soundtrack be amazing ! altough not all of they be my favourite , but I can say that the soundtrack sound very different with another korean Dramas . it be , cool , creepy , gloomy , sad , and sometimes a little bit warm . altough I love most of they , I could n\\'t say that the lyric of they be easily to be remember . I be so proud of Sungjae \\'s acting ! he show his act skill just get well and well ! and also , I feel so proud of Lee Dong Wook ! thank to God he be shine brighter with this drama . since , in my opinion , he have so many drama before , but I guess not all of they be enjoyable for some kdrama lover . altough , I fall for he since his perfomance in \" Hotel King \" . he be so hot in there , bruh ! his wing tattoo on his back be my fav part of he to look at ! lmao . and his chemistry with Lee Da Hee feel so real ! since , Hotel King be the second time he play as the main lead together with Lee Da Hee . now I have decide to watch this drama just because of the cast at first because when I first hear it be come out I have no idea what it be go to be about . I mean even the trailer be very vague and I actually do n\\'t try to find out what the storyline be go to be like lolSo as soon as I start watch this I got suck into it the world because the cinematography be amazing in this just like most korean drama but the execution be amazing for this . as I get to the end of the first episode I just fall in love with every character in the drama . the way the cast portrait the character be just amazing and I highly doubt any other actor would have be able to do any well than this!the story gets confuse a bit at time I mean they do n\\'t get in depth on some subject but still it do n\\'t ruin it for you although it would have be a nice touch if they have elaborate . they be hilarious moment , extremely sad and some freaky moment . they just know how to make you feel a mix range of emotion and that be what make I love this drama even more . the bromance be amazing ! I mean one of the good I have see so far , and the actual romance be sweet and I \\'ll be honest I usually do n\\'t like it when the main lead have such a huge age gap but it actually do n\\'t seem weird in this drama , and I be actually not be bias lolthe soundtrack . one word ... amazing . I usually like a lot of ost but this one be so good I have to download they and listen to they on repeat for a good 2 week after I finish the whole drama!all in all this be a drama you will not regret watch honestly . the good drama of the year so far and I \\'ll be honest I do n\\'t think anything will top this for a while for I personally!It be a meaningful drama which convey the message for we to appreciate our life . enjoy every moment of it . the drama be kinda funny as well , overall it be very exciting and anticipating.12/10 . down right the good . it not only set a new standard but will forever be in its own category . absolutely amazing , never a dull moment . this drama be one of my top ten favorite out of all 117 drama I have watch so far . the good korean drama ever . the storyline , cast , cinematography , sound effect , original soundtract be perfect . daebakk!!love the romance and bromance.and love Kim Go Eun \\'s skill . she can potray her role . AmazingWhat can I say that the other review have n\\'t already ? choose this one ! watch it ! no really watch it!This must be add to my list of favorite korean Dramas . I be amazed at how these asian drama be start to get well and more unique every year , and Goblin be definitely a piece of gold in this big and wide range of korean Dramas . I have to start off with the storyline . I \\'ve always be quite a fan of mythical creature , especially story about japanese deity and god in anime . when I first see that this story revolve around similar folklore beast and spirit , I be swiftly draw into it . it be quite a ride see the mythical creature be portray by the amazing and super talented actor . I mean , the Goblin and the Grim Reaper \\'s bromance speak for itself . at first glance , I think that the main couple , the Goblin and his bride , be kind of strange and unrelatable , but they make such a cute connection during the series . I \\'ve be familiar with Kim Go Eun \\'s acting in Cheese in the Trap so it be quite a surprise see her act as a bubbly and fun character , unlike the other drama . however , my big appreciation of romance go to the ultimate grim Reaper and sunny . their screen time be so strong and make I quite anxious each and every episode ... their chemistry be unbelievable , they definitely need a separate series ! * totally would watch*the OST be select perfectly . love the little touch of incorporate classical and pop music . the breathtaking shot of the nature and Quebec make the visual of this drama out of this world unforgettable!Not only do this drama combine polar genre like comedy , romance , history and tragedy into one harmonize series , but also it combine existential and every day problem with the perception of time . never have a korean drama change my view on death and love like Goblin . this be worth appear onto national television it be that good ! I be gon na miss it , but it be also in a need of a re - watch sometime soon!I do n\\'t know how to review this marvellous drama . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ❤ ️ word \\'s be n\\'t enough to describe how amazing it be to watch this drama . when I start watch this show I have already know that this be the most popular K drama . from 1st episode till last you get attach with it . this be one of the good drama seriously ... full of all sort of emotion .. a damn positive drama ... last episode bring you to another world & you can feel it ... some scene really make I cry ... not solely belong to romcom but Soo More than that . plot of this drama be unique & strong , extremely amazing!!acting ... what to say ... everyone do their job perfectly ... but I praise Gong yoo & Kim Go - Eun . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? she be amazing seriously ... and bromance between Lee dong wook and Gong yoo be cute though . and mesmerizing OST ... specially stay with I , Heaven , beautiful life , I miss you , good background score .. hat off to the maker and everyone who make this drama so special. ❤ ️????????if there be any doubt for this drama , throw it away , because this be an Ultimate One . one word for this drama be \" classic \\'\\' ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? just love it . it be perfect from 1st episode to the last one , I be glad that I \\'ve watch it . I have cry , laugh , this drama create lot of emotion ... all time favourite .. you should watch it , because you \\'ll never regret it . Gong Yoo ( oh my GOBLIN ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) an amazing actor , be perfect with that role & Kim Go Eun(Ji Run Tak ) she be just fabulous actress . support role be too good . Lee Dong Woom be perfect as grim Reaper . many thing which be good in this drama be it be role coaster like plot , it make I Laugh , cry , smile & most importantly curious & Furious . Hat be Off to the Actors Directors & specially those who create OST of this drama , I mean how some Songs & Background Score can be so perfect & emotional ! ! ! still I be speechless ... word be less to appreciate this drama . 100/10 ⭐ I love Goblin ! it be definitely a show that take you on an emotional roller coaster . one of my favorite thing about this show be the character development . the chemistry all the actor have with each other be amazing and it be so exciting to see how they change throughout the series . yes , Kim Go Eun be young compare to other but I think she fit the role perfectly and really bring Ji Eun Tak to life . even though I cry watch Goblin , I would definitely watch this again and recommend it to everyone!should you ? would you ? could you?You should watch this one ( yes ! ) you would recommend this to other . ( YES!)You could watch this again . ( yes)i just ca n’t believe what I see . what a story ! what direction ! what act ! if one get down to analyze this drama , you will end up confuse yourself so just go with the flow . this be a perfect combination of a good story that be execute by great direction and bring to such good life thank to these amazing actor . if anyone of these element would go wrong , then you would have a mishmash of a drama . I can not credit any single department for the success of this one but all in a whole . I can not imagine anyone write such a concept of a grim reaper and a goblin cohabit with the potential goblin \\'s bride ! it ’ too bizarre yet so beautifully execute . the concept of divinity and reincarnation be so well explore in this . the actor be amazing in their respective role . the interaction between the goblin and the grim reaper be just too hilarious . each one of they bring their character to life with such conviction . I can go on and on rave about Goblin but would love for you to see it . an eleven on ten for this one . my first kdrama as an adult ( not count the one I watch as a kid when I do n’t really have a choice ) . I ’m be not into kdrama so I be n’t part of the Goblin hype when this be release . I’ve be on drama slump lately ( I ’m into cdrama ) , so I think I ’d try this just to see how I go . I end up love it a lot ! 9/10 because there be just scene I find too slow , drag and repetitive . I ’ve be listen to stay with I since 2016 because I like it so I be surprised at how powerful the OST be . I ’m the type who get really emotional on ost , so ost be a big factor for I when watch drama . now , one of my favorite be Round and Round , give I nostalgic feel . believe it or not , from 2016 I never know what the story be about even if it ’ so popular , I do n’t come across spoiler . maybe because I just do n’t really pay attention haha!love all the character and all of their chemistry . Kim Shin be such a cutie!!watched this drama about a year ago because it be literally everywhere , and seem like a must - have if you like K - Drama like I ! so I say to myself:\"Why not give it a try ! ? \" .   it turn out to be a pretty basic K - drama . music \\'s and place be gorgeous , and the story in itself have a strong basement for a really wonderful and well make show but sadly turn out to be the classic dramawith a good add of romance . also I \\'ve found it really confuse since they do n\\'t close al lot of question , like the one about the headstone and the relationship with the place in Canada . plus they add a LOT of repeat scene nearly the end of the show , especially the one pf he walk in the snow tempest . sadly I be notgonna give this show a rewatch be reallyhard and boringto follow in many piece ... I start to watch kdrama 2 month agoI start with some kdrama with high review and most popular , I like they but not much , when I find goblin and read the summary I do n\\'t like it at first , but I decide to give it a try , first ep be so boring but I also have feeling that it would be well , and I be totally right!It \\'s perfect ! story , music , cast they be all perfect , I still look for drama like this masterpiece!Iam not a fan of those kind of story but I start to love they after Goblin , you should give it a try!!!note : some episod be too long but not boring if you watch 1ep each day . Loljust an advice for you ❤ it be hard not be able to talk about what happen in this drama because it be all I really want to do . and of course , I know I be not allow to spoil anything , as I understand that there be still some people who have n\\'t watch this yet . but what could be more important than this ? ! actually , do n\\'t answer that . I be well aware of the fact that there be far more important thing to take care of . but anyway , I think this drama definitely deserve all of the attention it be be garner . with a storyline as unique as this one , it be no wonder people find it so refreshing . \\xa0 plus , the cinematography be just beyond amazing , make I especially envious of the fact that I do n\\'t get to live in their so - call reality . the villain , however , be introduce a little too late in my opinion . I would \\'ve love to see he early on in the series . on the other hand , the chemistry on this set be absolutely incredible . I be super thankful because it be for this reason that these actor be able to grace we with so many fantastic ad - libs to look back on in the first place . all of the actor / actress have their fair share of memorable moment but ultimately , I do n\\'t think anything will ever compare to the bromance between the Goblin and the grim Reaper . even though the original soundtrack do a fine job at capture its overall theme , there be only a few that I could actually see myself listen to outside of this drama . that be n\\'t to say that the music be bad . it just do n\\'t fall under my preference . the soft ballad , however , feel like whisper of the heart : soft yet powerful . and for those , I love every second of it . overall , I have an interesting time be take on this emotional rollercoaster . unfortunately , I be n\\'t nearly as satisfied with the ending as I be with the rest of this drama . at first , it seem like a happy ending but the more I seem to think about it , the sad it truly be . it be sort of like the feeling you get when you receive a delicious - look cookie , but the taste just do n\\'t turn out as good as it look . as far as recommendation go , I would still encourage people to give this drama a try . and although I wish I be give a well ending , it be not bad enough to the point where I would n\\'t rewatch it . with that say , Llama out . well the first thing I have to say about this drama be almost PERFECTION!My favourite drama of all time , for sure!I can not say when be the last time I see a drama like this and fall in love with it from the beginning to the end , be so well do . the chemistry between the actor be always there , between all of they and kudo for the main couple , even tho the female lead be young than her male lead co star and have less experience , she be sooo good at it , I mean she have such potential she can mesmerize you with just one look , her eye speak in every scene with such emotion it give I chill . I love it!The male lead be also fantastic , he have way more experience of course and many act skill under his belt already but he still surprise I on how good and natural his acting be and he be so good with his young female co star , they work very well together . he be such a handsome cute bear :D I just want to hug he all the time and wish I be in her shoe XD ( shame on I I know lol but I really could n’t help it , I fall in love with he and her < 3)the story itself develop at a nice pace , I have no complaint what so ever and the whole production and special effect be through the roof on this one as well , major skill there and a great investment on the director and writter part , I as a viewer be both delighted and honor to be able to see it and enjoy this drama so much :) the character grow as the story go as well , it deal with a lot of issue between life and death , pain and betrayal but also have a kind and comic side to it , some funny and heart warm moment to balance the mood set through the story and it be really well do , as to not always be sad and heavy , nor be it too bubbly and happy all the time . a good and perfect balance between the 2.It \\'s a love story , a very deep one no less but it end up also be so much more at the end of the day . it pan out into so many branch and possibility , as we see the character live get mix up together , all the problem and obstacle that show up and mess up their peace of mind . I got hook up with this drama from day one and I could n’t stop myself from do a marathon with all the episode until I finish . I be just so draw into the story and the main couple I could n’t look away , I always want more , I want to know what be gon na happen next , with all of they . I laugh , I get second hand embarassment , I giggle like a crazy girl fangirle about something cute , I actually get excited to get a decent kiss and some real intimate demonstration for affection from the main couple , I be surprised and shock with some revelation , all the joy and sadness , I cry my eye out so bad for the whole thing , I feel the love and it warm my heart deeply , it be really a roller coaster of emotion for I . when I end watch it I be no long the same person and I love this drama for it.(just a side note , I mean I know that they be portray a big age difference between the main lead and they want to keep it pure and innocent until she \" officially \" be an adult in the story but c’m on , I ’ve see young actor and people do way bad thing on tv show when they be play love scene - and I ’m leave the skinship out of this conversation ok?- but a good and normal passionate kiss wo nt kill or steal someones innocence for god sake . what go on in these people mind completely amaze I and not in a good way . I mean people in love they kiss , they hug , it be not like I ’m ask they to get naked and have some more steamy moment but a bit more intimacy like all couple have . I guess another reason be also the judgement from the korean viewer , people often discriminate about these thing and public demonstration of affection as well . it get I trigger a bit I mean , its just a kiss or a hug , if you want to show someone you love they , even in public , there should n’t be any judgement , its not like they be commit a crime for fricking sake . Geshhh people , you see bad thing on the street everyday and you do n’t judge as much , go figure t_t I ’ll stop rant now , sorry XD)My heart be never the same after watch it . it raise way high my stake on drama to a whole new level and I ’m afraid nothing come after it can even begin to compare . I highly recomend it and to watch it a milion time over and over , until your heart and soul be both content XDThis show . I love this show . I watch it when it be first come out , and let I just tell you : that first episode ? hit I hard . I love the balance of funny with badass that they have with the Goblin ( whom be my favorite actor ) and the grim Reaper ( whom be now on my favorite actor list ) . this whole show be a great juggling act of funny and sad and romance . it be brilliantly do in my opinion ~ honestly , the only thing I do n\\'t like be the ending , which be a bit much and kinda pointless , but alas~ it be still good , and it honestly do n\\'t take that much away for I ~ okay . let I tell you this , I be a big Gong Yoo fan . I be part of the old generation where I get to watch kdrama VCD day . and I \\'ve watch all Gong Yoo movie and drama and know that he will always be that movie and tv star a - lister . so I watch this while it be still air and I be already utterly disappointed within a couple of episode . I already know what be gon na happen . the pain they be try to go through for the Tokkaebi to find someone who will actually and finally can kill he . his bride . nice premise , but you wo n\\'t get surprised where it take you because it be set up right at the beginning . even with the character . the moment Kim Min Jae \\'s character go into the screen , I know who he be in the present . because who else would it be ? everything be just so obvious . what really make I hold on be of course , Gong Yoo , and the adorbs KGE , although I be not really in love with the ajusshi thingy . so yes , to give it a chance before go here for rating , I watch it again , and feeling remain the same , if not even low . I be so sorry . the cinematography be top - notch . the music be also so so so so good . the scoring . the OST . Main OST be an earworm , but that do n\\'t actually save the drama for I . will I watch it again?maybe not . I guess I be really not a fan of writer . maybe the last drama that I like from she be Secret Garden , which actually take I three year to finish . I drop it two time in two year , until I pick it up . but this , I be not sure why I hold on and be disappoint still . this be my opinion . the only reason I give this drama a chance be because of Gong Yoo . I \\'ve   be his fan since Coffee Prince   and have n\\'t see he in many K drama since . although the story start off a little slow , it quickly pick up and draw you into the main character life and issue .   with this drama I laugh , I cry ( and I mean ugly cry ) along with the character . I would highly recommend this drama to most people if for no other reason than the OST , however this drama ( in my opinion ) have everything . two thumb up!??context : I watch this first in 2017 and then re - watch it early this 2020.After watch Goblin the first time , I remember that one of the reason I like to so much be because of all the plot twist in the story . I do n\\'t expect the challenge they be present with as they come . and this make I enjoy the show , want to know how each piece of information connect to another . I also like how they connect the present situation with the past of the Goblin . I also really enjoy the relationship among the main cast . aside from the Goblin and bride , I also like watch the interaction with sunny , grim Reaper and the nephew . the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper be also really cute and nicely develop . one of the issue I have with the story be the relationship between the Goblin and his bride . it be difficult for I to accept a love story between a high school student and an immortal being who look like he be in his late 30 . if I do n\\'t focus on their suppose romance , I think their chemistry suit they well as a HS student and a 39 year old man . what I appreciate the most after re - watch it be that some of my question answer ( I do n\\'t bother re - watch back in 2017 ) and I feel like I could accept the way the show end when I do n\\'t really like it before . I also have to say that re - watch this lose of the magic for I . it use to be one of my favorite , but it be not one of my top 5 anymore . whether from re - watch it or because I find other drama I like well , I be not so sure . I probably wo n\\'t watch it again for a long time . if you be try to decide whether or not to watch this , I still highly recommend it . if you enjoy show with an interesting plot and good twist , interesting character that also have their own story ( aside from the main ) and do n\\'t mind the fantasy element , you should check this show out.i could go on for day about why you should watch this drama but to keep it short : the drama have a perfect mix of an enticing story with condition that keep you on edge every episode , so many fckn feel that be all over the place , actually funny humor that be unique to this show , a lovable cast that you ca n\\'t help but grow attach to , the most amazing   cinematography and an I c o n I c   soundtrack that get stuck in your head after one episode . it be pretty much the ultimate package and do n\\'t lack in anything.to top this all off , goblin be one of those show where you just continue watch and easily become addicted . every k - drama be mean to function that way to keep your attention , but this be the only drama where I do n\\'t move , sleep or eat until I finish it and I regret nothing.if you still have n\\'t watch this drama even after literally everybody talk about it , you be severely miss out and I recommend you to start right fckn now.p.s many thank to goblin for introduce I to lee dong wook , who be my favourite actor now . if you like the grim reaper x sunny ship , you might wanna check out \\'\\' touch your heart \\'\\' next , as they be the main character in that drama too . I like to think this be the reincarnate life they lead after goblin end . Goblin be the very first KDrama I ’ve ever watch and I ’m so glad about it . honestly , even now that I have watch a few more drama , I still think that   Goblin be the good drama ever . first of all , the storyline be very unique and sweet . from the very first episode it push you to the edge of your seat and make you feel with the character . although the episode run up to 90 minute , I never feel like they be try to protract the story . in addition , the actor ’ excellent performance make a major contribution to this circumstance . it be inevitable to not feel any emotional attachment to the character . I ca n’t even count how often they make I laugh out loud or shed litre of tear . the chemistry of the two couple be so intense , sweet and tragic that it even make my heart flutter . the Goblin and Eun Tak as well as sunny and the Grim Reaper be just so sweet together . you ca n’t get enough of they . besides that , the bromance of the Grim Reaper and the Goblin be just spectacularly hilarious . in my opinion , it be definitely one of the good part of this drama . I replay their scene just way too often . all in all , Goblin be definitely a must see drama . if you have n’t watch it yet … what be you wait for ? you wo n’t regret it and I ’m sure you will love it as much as I do . I ca n’t even express the emptiness I feel in my heart after finish this show . I have put off watch Goblin for a long time as I know it be epic so I need a devoted time to watch it till the end . goblin become the high standard of my review on drama I complete ( mostly for kdramas).what I learn from this drama : forgiveness ( past event of Goblin / grim Reaper / sunny ) and that there be time for everything you encounter in life ( Goblin wait for 900 + year for a 19 year old bride to show up in her first life)ton of previous review post already , so I will just point out what I like about this drama : story : no boring scene , no skipping for I who like skip scene . side story of dead people and ghost be also meaningful and touching . direct : just perfect , wo n\\'t say much , check out other Director Lee Eung Bok \\'s cinematic workediting : detail be weave perfectly , and all related . piece of flashback be not boring . screenwriting : witty , deep , poetic . Follow writer Kim Eun Sook for other high quality drama . cgi : battle , fight , and snow scene of Goblin be epiclocation : Quebec Canada , ca n\\'t have other perfect location than fall season with French touchmake up : can transform one actor / actress to different role . for examplem Kim Byung Chul as Emperor advisor , modern secretary , ghost , and cameo CEO.Costume : classy and stylish . for example : 19 year old Eun Tak do not look poor and childish . personality symbol thru costume , for example Shamsin Lady \\'s red dress , Sunny \\'s bright colored clothing , and Eun Tak \\'s red scarfcast : perfect selection for every main role and support cast be not bad either . Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook supernatural role do n\\'t need to talk much but their facial expression show deep communication . Kim Go Eun \\'s natural beauty fit for 19 year old girl , Yoo in Na \\'s cheerfulness match sunny lively personality . act : lot of scene with no dialogue just facial expression and physical movement speak louder than many dialoguesMusic : song be create and pick perfectly support the popularity of the drama and song themselvesRewatch : perfect , but I will wait for a while until I can spend a large portion of my time to watch itjust the perfect drama for me!I have my reservation on watch this drama at first but , oh boy be I glad that I resist .   I be hook since the first episode and never do it fail to surprise I as the story progress . this be one drama that do n\\'t have love triangle storyline , no forced or guilty feeling romance ( which be rare for korean drama not to have , and that be what I like about this drama ) .   what you will see be just sweet and even funny romance scene . the cinematography and music be simply perfect .   and the chemistry among all the cast be also great . for those who have not see this drama , what be you wait for?I think this show be overrated , due to the good and famous ost \\' and actor , but the story be a little empty for it to be as famous as it be . the main lead look strange together due to the large age difference , even though their chemistry make up for it . Gong Yoo still have more chemistry with both Dong Wook and Sung Jae than Go Eun . I think I enjoy in Na \\'s and Dong Wook \\'s relationship more , because they be more age appropiate and also , because they have more history and chemistry together . I would \\'ve enjoy they as the main couple more than the actual one . this drama now be my fav drama I ever watch . the story be unique . you ca n\\'t decide which ending will be serve . I try to figure out the ending at first with my own fantasy . but you have to watch it till the end to know the real ending . and it be full of surprise . the music be loveable . I can hear this soundtrack day by day without get bored . and every soundtrack make I remember the scene . I highly recommend this drama for you . if you try to watch your first korean drama , this be perfect for you . if Goblin and I be in a facebook relationship , our status will say \" it be complicated \" .   I have a lot of fun watch this fantasy world Kim Eun Sook create , and I look forward to it every week , but feel it lack the deep emotional hook kdrama be so good at . after the premiere , the pacing be meander ( to pull the sword or not fiasco ) , Eun Tak feel too needy , and I be unable to connect with sunny due to her limited screen time . but the cast be so endearing , it be Gong Yoo \\'s first drama back in so long , his chemistry with Lee Dong Wook be so on point , Shin & Grim Reaper be adorkable beta hero kdramaland do n\\'t always get , and I be a sucker for fantasy about god so I stick on . it might have start with getting entertain only through Shin \\'s first love squeee , but gradually per episode , I be feel more for the OTP . once Eun Tak admit her neediness come from a place of fear of be alone , it be truly wondrous to watch she settle down and mature . I \\'ve grow to appreciate how good their relationship be , finally not keep secret from each other and just a great support system for one another . they choose to fight their destiny together , and not go all noble idiotic on I ( or rather noble idiocy I can get behind on).Once the show finally get over the first pulling of the sword out of the way , the pacing improve and slowly build up . when most of kdrama lose their way at the end , Goblin be part of that 1 % that save the good for last and go out with a bang , leave I with all the feel and tear that make it all worth it after all . fault and all , I \\'ll always treasure the drama for what it have do for the kdrama fantasy romance genre ( which I be crave more of ) . and like the rest of Goblin fandom , I know I \\'ll forever feel a little bit blue when the rain fall . if you be wonder whether you should watch it or not , you definitely should . the plot be all over the place and could \\'ve be much well . I still do n\\'t quite get why Gong Yoo should be a Goblin . the main antagonist feel very weak and kind of unnecessary the show could \\'ve do without he altogether . they seem to complicate thing far more than they should for no reason . the age gap between the two main couple annoy I at first since both of they be great actor but they do much well when they have a partner with sizzling chemistry but I choose to ignore it and just enjoy it . the acting and the comedy make up for some of the plot hole . I sometimes wish they would \\'ve get the fantasy genre out of the drama altogether because they seem like they could n\\'t commit much to it . they want the Goblin and the grim reaper \\'s power without all the complicated background . however , despite all this I finish it yesterday and I feel so sad I could n\\'t sleep . the soundtrack be really beautiful and all the character \\'s acting be top notch . it feel like I \\'ve be watch this for a lot long than just 16 episode , which make sense , since one episode be an hour and a half basically . I think the good way to enjoy this kind of drama be to not get too work up about what be go to happen at the end but to fully enjoy the scene in every episode and treat it as a single movie . the two main male character be my favorite thing in the drama . they even have more friendly / brotherly chemistry than the main couple . Gong Yoo be amazing as usual , I ca n\\'t get over how well he can really portray every single emotion with just his eye . Lee Dong Wook be adorable here . I love the two female lead as well they do a great job .   I love every character present here Mr. Kim the secratary , Yu Chairman and Deok Hwa be so adorable and such scene stealer . this be probably my favorite ensemble cast for 2017.a fantastic drama minus the love line of the main lead if I be be honest . if the writer just focus on the story of Kim Shin , Wang Yeo / grim Reaper , and sunny then it would have be meaty . I just find their story more engaging and ripe with conflict start from 900 year in the storyline . but well , what be a KES drama without cheesy romance , right ? also , the chemistry between the cast ( sorry , main lead not include - I just ca n\\'t see / feel it ) be superb ! the banter Goblin and GR , Deokhwa and his samchon , sunny and GR , even sunny and the Goblin . the overall concept and story be do well . I be even invest in GR \\'s tea house . I think that if GR have a drama of his own , focus on the soul come to his tea house , I \\'d watch it . from the few scene we \\'ve see , it be both heartwarming , funny , sad , and sometimes infuriating . who could forget about the dog who wait for his / her pawrent so they can both go to the afterlife ? it also touch on the concept of life and death and rebirth , how in life , we be present with choice and it be we who ultimately choose which to take . the angst between GR and the Goblin , and of course , GR and sunny be well do as well . you understand each character and why they choose to do the thing they do . at the end of the drama , I just ca n\\'t help but feel something bittersweet about the Goblin . he make his choice and that entail be alone forever when the time come that Eun Tak ca n\\'t reincarnate . the drama just leave a taste of sadness . I remember we be in Korea when this drama be air . everywhere we go , I hear the OST be play . it be one of the few drama that I like all ost . the song really leave a mark and it be use well in the drama . even now when I hear stay with I , I still feel a little bit of sadness . it be not a perfect drama but it be good in all the right place . the story be quite original . the ML be a goblin .   a goblin be like a god with extraordinary power . I really expect that he would lose his power at some point in the drama as this always happen in dramas with someone that have power . but this drama do n’t do that . it be completely original throughout the drama and never follow the normal drama storyline that I get so tired of . I like that there be no love triangle , no constant misunderstanding between the main lead , no repetitive makeup and breakup , no connive family member , or any of the other typical issue that pop up in most drama . this drama be completely original in everything which be what make it so refreshing . it have a little bit of everything ; romance , mystery , intrigue , fantasy , comedy ,   sadness and happiness . the side character be absolutely awesome and really add to the charm of the drama . it ’ originality , amazing acting , and superb special effect make it stand out . I ’ve watch hundred of drama include Chinese , japanese , korean , and taiwanese drama . but this one remain in my top ten .   there ’ really nothing bad to say about this drama . just go and watch it!Well this be amazing I ca n\\'t say anything bad about it , it be a beautiful story . the music be amazing I download all the song after see the movie . the actor do a great job , it really feel great when you see it you feel like it be really you ca n\\'t wait to see the next episode . I cry the tear of joy and happiness and sadness but it be all worth it I would recommend everyone to see this . my favourite song be beautiful by Crush   follow by who be you by Sam Kim . story line be the good , it remind you or we why we love and remember the one we love or once love , all the act of good and bad they be part of one to make a choice this what we see here . this be a show I recommend to everybody . it be get everything you could want and more . I \\'ll admit that it be n\\'t the most mature / serious show in some part , however I think that be just how Gong Yoo work ; he be just get a knack for that kind of character . I be seriously absorb into this show , and I do n\\'t even want to skip the part with the secondary lead ( Lee Dong Wook and Yoo in Na ) because they be so good too , they all have such chemistry . the bromance be super fun to watch too . I just find myself come back and then laugh or cry . it be SUPER sad ! you have be warn . I must also note that the music be fantastic and really stay stuck in your head , even now I can hear a song from the show playing in my head . you will want to look up the soundtrack after you \\'ve see it and keep it somewhere safe.i love the chemistry between the main lead sooooooo muchi hope they make another drama with same castspecially dong wook & in naall about the story be amazing the romance part be brilliant I love it   exceptthe religious part about god & angel I feel it be really disgrace my mindand the end as usual*if the writer be control destiny and God \\'s behavior y he do n\\'t make the goblin \\'s bride immortal as him*y he do n\\'t make his friend & his sister remember him*y he insist   till the end to torture & punish he for something be n\\'t his faultommo that be really bother I alotA lot of drama bite off more than they can chew when tackle plot and after binge watch show after show that could n\\'t neatly tie their story line together , Goblin be a happy surprise . Goblin focus one two couple and their epic story of growth , tragedy , and just daily life . the plot itself be rather simple and thin , but still enjoyable . the show be full of cute and funny scene that will keep you watch . keep in mind , the show feel more like a slice of life rather than a supernatural adventure , so if you be out for some magical battle , Goblin be n\\'t the show to watch . an issue that prevent I from fully immerse myself in the story be the main protagonist \\' love story . there be no real build up to help you understand why Eun Tak and Kim Shin fall in love . they both need something from on another , whether it be to end an immortal life or just have the support of someone , but it be not enough to help solidify why they eventually fall in love . there be something lack in their bud romance leave it awkward and strange until you simply decide to accept it for what it be and keep watch . overall , have simple story line to follow allow Goblin \\'s pacing to breath leave a ton of space for a lot of the funny moment I mention early . and , like many other drama , the flashback be overused . couple of tick on the fast forward button and you \\'ve get a light and enjoyable drama . this drama truly be something else , from someone who loves watch drama to see how plot could potentially develop/ how character could potentially develop ; this be probably one of my top 3 drama of all time . I\\'ll start with simple aspect like the cinematography , background music and ost be breathtaking , I can not flaw they in that aspect . the director be truly genius with the way they decide to film , cinematography in this drama hold a lot of meaning behind it , sometimes it would take someone to look twice to notice . plot wise I must say it one of the most original thing I have ever watch , the plot develop well and contain no visible hole that I could criticise , usually creator would fill those hole with unnecessary side plot or love triangle or underdeveloped character , however , the plot of this drama be complete in every way . just the right balance between reality and fantasy , a very thin line that not many drama be able to hold onto very well . the plot stay true to itself ; when say thing be go to happen , it will happen . no shortcut or exception just because the main character where involve , that be what I like about this drama , it refuse to stick to resolve the plot and dismiss main point just for fan satisfaction . all in all , the plot be incredibly thorough and captivating , heart wrenching but also somewhat warm . I think the thing that surprise I the most about this drama be how the character be all so developed , no one be completely good , no one be completely bad and they all have their own struggle . I do n\\'t think there be a single water down character or a character that do not suit the plot . they be all so attach to one another and that be something you rarely in see in drama , usually it be the male character attach to the female character and the 2nd lead attach to the 2nd lead female . however , you get to see they all rely on one another , physically and emotionally attach to one another . the chemistry between the main male lead be invincible as well as the chemistry between the female lead , this drama truly show that love be an umbrella to many different type i.e. brotherly love , platonic love , romantic , etc . likewise , the romantic aspect of it be also very well think , the chemistry between the actor feel so real I almost think they be date in real life . and many more yesse for this melodramatic goblin - reaper drama that will spook you out for a few century , at least . the tension between the reaper and chicken - restaurant owner be fun to watch , and bring balance to the teeny - bopper crush and tear of the main protagonist . a plodding , philosophical drama on life , the supernatural , and our timely existence . breathtaking view of the walled fortress of Quebec City bring back fond memory . good acting by all , though I prefer the support couple . Goblin be one of those ground - break , exceptional drama that everyone , no matter their genre preference , will surely appreciate , if not love . the drama provide we with not just romance , but also fantasy , history , tragedy and comedy at once and nail they all in one go . it deliver an outstanding and picture - perfect plot that will leave an unwavering impression on you in the end . the plot be the absolute star in the drama . it be so complex yet so brilliantly weave . and not all writer could do that . it be honestly , one of the good plot I \\'ve ever know . it deliver everything you would want from a well - write background story to the plot hole and cliffhanger , the unexpected plot twist , the intricate mixed emotion deliver in every scene , to   the move romance . Gong Yoo pair up with Kim Go - eun be surprising and refreshing . it be a pairing we do not see come but it be a perfect pairing for the drama . I be initially relecutant with the two as their huge age gap be evident in the beginning . but the drama and the story be able to ease up that awkward phase and soon fade away . it do n\\'t matter anymore as the plot be just too good to even nitpick those very few flaw . I have high respect to the writer , Kim Eun - sook , for create such an original , quintessential script . I fall in love with the story before I even realize it . and the way she carefully and cleverly weave the subplot to the main plot be a stroke of genius . and with strong lead , it would \\'ve be easy for the minor character to fade into the background . but with the drama , everyone seem to be the main character . each character have a story to tell that be relevant to the entirety of the plot . every one be charming and ultimately earn a place in my heart . for one , Lee Dong - wook \\'s brilliant portrayal of Grim Reaper be hard to miss . he be first introduce with a villainous vibe but soon become a love character that tug our heart in the most beautiful and tragic way . even with a minor character such as Yook Sung - jae \\'s Deok - hwa , he definitely deliver like a main character in the drama . he stand side - by - side with the big character and earn his own spotlight . an artist can not always be a good actor , but Sung - jae be an exception . the OST be also one of the good I \\'ve ever listen to . I be never into a drama \\'s music , much less the entire soundtrack . but with Goblin , every song be a perfect hit . it be melodious , haunt , eerie , and beautiful . overall , Goblin be a picture - perfect drama that definitely deserve a spot right next to the timeless classic . it be pure poetry paint exquisitely for everyone to indulge . because goblin story come from grimreaper sunny .... who be his bride what be her role ... etc be note according story .... goblin story start just becaz of grimreaper and sunny love story .then how could we do n\\'t get proper romance of sunny grim reapper .. nor in humanic life atlast last 2 epi want only about they . Goblin get heart touch story for grimreaper fault in his life and his life time separation from his love . his love sunny be innocent but bread between brother and husband . her life get spoil but still love grim reapper that be the reason I fall for this show . and Lee dong wook and yooinna steal my heart by their natural chemistry and ofcaz goblin and grimreaper ( brother in law and goblin ) bro romance the good part of show .... I hate how they story developee . they could kill the main violent by grim reapper because he actually kill the king both life ... note lose of goblin . because he be bear to be general of country . in any war he would die and call hero .he have no love affection . it be ok but after that what could with the connection of goblin bride why .... he and grimreaper could hold the sword .. that goblin bride part be most illogical unnecessary part and yes their romance like old man romance with his student their have note good word for goblin and his bride romance be seriously valueless where story begin from grimreaper sunny goblin and ender too with this 3 Charecter clear up the mristry . the most annoying part be goblin and bride romance ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? and most touchy part be grimreaper sunny true love story and good chemistry be Lee dong wook and yooinna togather be good alwaysI have put off watch Goblin for the long time because from what I have hear of it I know it would become my favorite drama out there , and I be right . I finish watch it a few day ago and from the very first moment to the very last I know that very few other drama will be able to top what this one make I feel . if you be hesitant to start it please have faith and take the plunge . I can almost guarantee you wo n\\'t be disappoint . the hype around it be well deserved . everything from the intricate and complex storyline , to the breathtaking acting , the superb score , the setting , the beautiful cinematography interweave to tell a heart - ache story about fate , love that can transcend time , karma , the power to change one \\'s own destiny and the strong bond of friendship . everything in this drama be intentional and everything serve a purpose . every scene help set the tone of the overarch story and help develop the character in meaningful way . you will find yourself hold your breath more than once!I will however warn that this drama be not for the weak of heart . the story be heavy with emotion and you will find yourself cry almost every episode . so if you be not look for an emotionally heavy drama , this might not be for you . but in my opinion every tear be worth it . you will be suck into a world that you will never want to get out of . truly a masterpiece ! I think I will be hard press to find another drama that can evoke the kind of feeling this one make I experience . Goblin . Goblin . Goblin . everyone know drama Goblin . bet there be no person who have not hear that title . grow my curiosity as well , begin it , and could nt really see what people would brag about this drama so much . so I think to myself its just I . the romance be a bit weird to I at first the age gap would make I kinda uncomfortable since Ji Eun Tak would act a bit childish even tho she be a 19 year old woman .   she be so demanding and clingy and the way she would talk annoyed   I a lot . and as a person who do nt enjoy comedy drama the first episode be I guess I should say , boring . I find myself   skip scene a lot . yet I do nt drop it . thankfully . even tho I think about it a lot . when the story begin getting explain and when   thing finally get more serious I realise why people love this drama . its way more deep than it seem in the first approximentally 8 - 9 episode . and it turn out that even the funny awkward moment this couple go through , have a very huge impact on they once seperate . the music be obviously the good and it only make thing more emotional just how it should . the ending be kinda sad to I because Goblin do nt age and he s still immortal which mean he s gon na witness Eun Taks death again and again and if she actually have 4 life there will be a moment where she wo nt be able to be bear again and that be one hella sad thought I just have . I be happy I do nt drop it even tho I \\'ll definitely never watch it again . it be a nice story consider I love historical drama . if there be n\\'t that many unnecessary scene I would have have a well opinion on this drama . unique and interesting storyline that keep up your interest . I do feel that the last few episode be drag unnecessarily , but otherwise enjoyable . the shoot quality be really great . good diversity of character and personality . actor and their performance be ok . my favorite duo be the Goblin and the grim reaper .   their scene be great fun . the soundtrack be fantastic and fit well with the drama . I would like to re - watch this in the future . overall an enjoyable experience . this be one of the few series that I want to rewatch immediately after finish it . the first half of the first episode have I unsure if this be the right series for I but as the story unfold , I be captivate and amaze by the cast . the Goblin \\'s sadness be palpable and my heart ache for he ; Eun Tak \\'s innocence be charming , her wisdom surprising and the Grim Reaper be a sight for sore eye . sunny seem to be one of those character you look over and do n\\'t pay much attention , but she surprise I early on . the actor do an amazing job bring to life these character ( either main or support one ) and they all shine through . the story itself be magnificent and compelling . it be n\\'t as simple as it appear with its twist and turn . until the final episode , you just be never sure about anything . I love how I go from tear of sadness to tear of laughter and how balanced the sad / dramatic scene be with the funny one . the relationship between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper be perfectly develop . in fact , I can definitely say that there be concise development to every relationship in this show and it be a joy to watch . be it the relationship between the Goblin and Eun Tak to the relationship between Eun Tak and she \\' out of this world \\' friend . overall , I ca n\\'t recommend this enough . I drag out the last couple of episode because I do not want it to end and , even as I write this review , I be consider change my evening plan to accommodate a rewatch of Goblin ( sorry current show ... ).i will end this review with one of my favorite quote ( hope this will entice you to watch Goblin!):“Mass be n’t proportional to volume . a girl as small as a violet , a girl who move like a flower petal – be pull I toward she with more force than her mass . just then , like Newton ’s apple , I roll toward she without stop until I fall on she with a thump . my heart keep bounce between the sky and the ground . it be my first love”I\\'m a huge fun of dash Gong Yoo . the other main lead also do a great job . there be too many great thing about this drama that be already be say and all I can say be \" ditto , I agree \" . two handsome man who look like they be on a catwalk while save someone or when they just go to the market , stand out the most when I think of \" most memorable moment \" for main male lead . they definitely steal our heart , do n\\'t you think ? the only downside be the obvious product placement and advertisement . aside from that , the story line , acting and cgi be on point and superb . a SMALL REVIEW for all of as who prefer to read only the gist : b :* I be in love with this k drama in every aspect ( story , acting , music ) , because they be all truly amazing   <3 <3 <3 . * I have rewatche it more time than I can count . * it be a really unique k drama . * word can not be enough for such a masterpiece . it combine in perfect harmony a story with element of : fantasy , ( beautiful ) romance , ( hilarious and very touching ) bromance , comedy and drama . the acting of all the cast be just great and the music ( OST )   touch your heart every time you hear it . * it be worth your time 100 % . * just watch it and you will understand immediately what I be talk about : b. you be not go to regret it , I can assure you about that :D :D : D.P.S : I really hope my opinion to be helpful to you :) .\"every second in this drama shine \" ( areum - dabke - nan ) beautifully & brilliantly\"once in a very long while , the star align to create truly transcendent art on screen . \" Goblin \" be an example of this , as the maturation of talented writer Kim Eun - Sook blend with nuanced directing , breathtaking cinematography and the formidable acting skill of Gong Yoo and the rest of the stellar cast . this be great art and great television , regardless of the country of origin . that be not to minimize the south korean expertise that create it , but simply to avoid the sometimes- backhanded compliment of \" great ... for a KDrama . \" it be just great tv , full stop . I\\'ve watch KDramas for about a decade , and this one be the good I \\'ve see . highly recommend , not just for drama fan , but for all fan of quality cinematic art around the world.oh boi , where do I even start with this drama ? I remember watch the first episode all the way back in 2016 when it be still on air and back then I be n\\'t really feel it , add it straight to my \" maybe I will finish it one day . maybe .. \" list . that one day happen to be today and I can tell you that I be honestly so glad I decide to give it another chance.the story be such an emotional rollercoaster , one minute I be laugh and the other I be about to cry but that be what make goblin so enjoyable to watch - it never get boring , from the beginning until the very end . there be some moment and scene that I do n\\'t particularly love and find a bit cringy but those be overnumbere by the high - quality one that make it so worth to watch . I have no choice but to give the cast 10/10 because the chemistry be simply great , be it the lead couple or the second lead . and , god , how could I not mention the goblin - reaper bromance , it be one of the reason why I decide to watch it , after all , there be no wonder why I hear so much about it - I know I keep repeat myself but they be great.the OST fit just right and always add the right mood to the story . I could n\\'t go for 10 star tho because even though I love like 99 % of they there be this one song that really annoy I haha . I be not sure why . maybe because it be play every time there be something shitty happen lol.this part do contain a spoiler but I just have to say it - as much as I enjoy the story , in general , I feel the ending could have be much well . in the last episode , after the car accident happen they keep mention something about angel and I really really want eun tak to come back as one and live happily ever after . from the way they put it I do n\\'t really understand what actually happen - be she human ? do her mom die again ? maybe it be explain there but I just do n\\'t get it because I be too emotional and sad that it be end however this be one of the thing that really make I anxious and the reason why I be not go to go all out and give it 10/10.i\\'m definitely sure that eventually I be go to watch it again and I would recommend everyone to give it a shot . you ca n\\'t go wrong with this - trust my word , it be worth it.now , this be not about goblin but I would like to mention that I just start watch   \" touch your heart \" where our familiar and beloved second lead couple be star . I watch many thing but it never happen to I to watch the same actor play a pair in two different drama . and it be really weird to see they play role so different from those I use to see they in . I be love it so far tho , hopefully , it be go to be just as awesome as goblin be . I want to give this a 10 after finish it but now that I think about it a bit I just could n\\'t . Goblin leave I with so many weird feeling ... the last couple of episode be very emotional and it be just a bit too much to process right away . the fact that the show end with the Goblin be immortal for real without any mean to eventually die make I incredibly sad . yeah , the girl get reborn and find he again and have four life leave ... but what happen after that ? everyone else be either dead or alive without any memory of he - this thought leave I absolutely depressed after finish the last episode . there be also lot of other thing that do n\\'t really get explain well or at all so that be pretty dissatisfying , too . what make this show great be the beautiful cinematography , the great acting and awesome mix of drama , intensity , comedy , supernatural and historical and even philosophical element and of course the bromance . however , the romance be kind of weird ... at first there be a lot of fake \\' I love yous \\' which somehow turn into real one yet this process of fall in love be only comprehensible consider the Goblin because Eun Tak bring so much light and joy and variety into his so far loooooong and kind of dull immortal life , plus she be his destiny and only chance of finally die ( which be why it be even more sad that he have to become immortal for real in order to be with she again ) . from her point of view ... well , he be tall and handsome and basically invincible , sweet and funny and oh , rich ... however , there be no real visible or emotionally tangible development of her romantic feeling for he . the kissing scene be cute but there be no real chemistry , however , thing change after he come back to life and she be 10 year old and obviously more mature . up from that point the romance become tangible , realistic and beautiful and , sadly , also heartbreaking . it be too bad that that period be very short and Eun Tak actually return to he as a high school student .... as mention before , the bromance be amazing and I absolutely love the dynamic between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper and the development of their friendship as well as the story of their share fate . Deok Hwa ( what happen to he in the end ? I be a very frustrated that he kind of got leave behind in the last couple of episode ) be also great and there be so many funny moment between those guy that lighten up the otherwise kind of heavy mood this drama mostly convey . as for the secondary couple sunny and the Grim Reaper ... I think their story be a much more relatable and deep love story but for some reason I do not really like sunny as a character and also feel that there be no real chemistry between they which make their love story kind of a waste potential . overall , as for the acting , I really love how the Goblin be portray although I find it strange how he behave like a silly love - strike teenager when he begin fall for Eun Tak but maybe that be to emphasize that it truly be his first love in over 900 year ? I mostly love how human and how   ( emotionally ) well connect to humanity the Goblin seem despite be a sort of demi god . I be not sure what exactly it be but he kind of give off this calm and serene aura that just make you feel comfortable just look at he . the Grim Reaper be also great and become more lively and loveable with every episode despite his past mistake . look at Eun Tak not as a part of the main couple but as a character by herself , I think the acting be brilliant especially the difference between her bubbly high school personality ( ok , it be debatable how realistic this be in her situation but it seem a typical thing in k - drama that poor girl beat by life remain cheerful and optimistic ... ) , after the Goblin die and she become depressed and after he come back and she seem way more mature and down to earth even in her \\' bubbly moments\\' . soooo , all in all , despite the huge plot hole , actually tragic ending and plain weird romance , this be still one of the good drama I have ever watch because it make I become so extremely emotionally invest ( seriously , I actually have to write this review in order to be able to process my emotion about this ! ) . it be a bit sad that it stay so much on the surface of philosophical aspect like the whole fate question , death / immortality , true worth of life in itself etc . because in the end , it make kind of hard to summarize what Goblin be all about . but still , even this weird mix be great and very enjoyable to watch so I can recomment it without any doubts!after 6 episode the attraction of this program imho be in inverse proportion to the volume of the romance scene between Kim Shin and Kim Go Eun - and it seem to be increase … … … ep 8 excellent , if a bit heavy - even kim go eun be good … .. get up to episode 13 I share the consensus that this be a top - flight drama . I put off watch the final episode 14 - 16 because I be reluctant for it to end . now I \\'ve watch ep . 14 which be clearly sequel in nature . I have to say I find it a hard slog , the sparkle have go , the interaction between Goblin , Grim Reaper and Deok Hwa sadly miss . if this continue I would have to say it be a mistake . they should have finish with ep.13 and maybe a brief \" follow up \" finish . do n\\'t mean to be b * * * * * , but the idea anyone or any supernatural entity would span the universe in eternal love to chase Kim Go Eun stretch credulity . take the plunge again at Ep . 14 well but I find the central romance utterly unconvincing , partly because it just go on far too long - there be a limit to the sweet endearment and exchange you want to hear . finish at last ! a suitably complex and , I be glad to say , unpredictable ending . ah , if only life - and death - be like that . turn whimsical again at the end , but inevitable I expect . be n\\'t it wonderful also how time can pass in a camera shot in tv drama ? prefer grim Reaper and sunny and Deok Hwa to Goblin and Eun Tak , though the latter do improve markedly towards the end when she stop play all \" kittenish \" . which remind I , what happen to Deok Hwa amidst all the complex coming and going at the end ? ? so annoying . the production value , background scenery and camera work be excellent throughout and the fashion sense fabulous - but when my mind keep go off the story to the clothe and background scenery , annoyingly miss the subtitle , desperately wait for the next scene with grim Reaper and/or Deok Hwa , it be clear that it be not entirely absorb my admittedly volatile brain . music almost entirely good . re - watch value ? well not any time soon , but the fashion , design and memory of the comic part may tempt I . still , there be nothing else for it , but to give it 10/10 for the overall achievement . just take I a few year to get around watch it , but I be so glad I do . the OST be hand down 10/10 . the good OST I \\'ve hear . it take I awhile to get hook into this drama , I find the first half a bit slow and odd ( especially the large age gap between the ML and FL ) , but I really enjoy the second half after I got use to it and really feel the character shine . the storyline be really different , and they do a great job at explain the backstory . I\\'ve now get all my candle light and hope that Gong Yoo just magically appear behind I . I wholeheartedly understand why people love this drama so much . it have many flaw , but it be still a ton of fun . in particular , the music of the main theme stay with you forever and add a special element to the show that I have n\\'t notice in any show since . everyone have write about the unstoppable bromance between Gong Yoo \\'s Kim Shin , the torment god , and Lee Dong Wook \\'s grim Reaper . and if you watch any behind the scene footage of the show , you can see why . they be just have the time of their life work together . unfortunately , there be a couple big   flaw that prevent this show from be close to perfect . for one thing , we learn very little about our brave heroine Eun Tak , which diminish our stake in her story . we do n\\'t get to see much of her past or her thought about the state of her life or the relationship she have with friend or family . and now that I think about it , I ca n\\'t name any character that we get to truly know in depth . a few well place monologue would have be useful to this end . I want to know about each character \\'s history and past struggle , and how they feel now . second , the main villain in the show be pretty absent until the very end . there be so much potential around explore the heart of the issue face by Eun Tak and Kim Shin and how they be try to protect each other and deal with their own issue , but it be n\\'t harness . one last thing I enjoy be the filming in Quebec . I be a canadian and that be quite a surprising treat to behold!Masterpiece . prefect . good . amazing . south korean tv Show . I be very hooked with this amazing story with good and sad moment after continue watch it the story be very well write ; however , I notice some moment do n’t make sense to I . despite these moment , I still go into it with high expectation . I want to learn more about the mystery of these character . the con only be age gap and the ending . I be not talk about the age of these people . it be their character / role . the ending be little cheesy , but I think that be not bad . I like the bromance moment between Goblin and Reaper . the actor and actress have a good job at control emotion . overall , it be good South Korea tv show ever I ’ve see so far . the good part be the cinematography , and the song be perfect . I want to thank Viki for license Guardian : the Lonely and great God , so we can enjoy watch it . I highly recommend this one to anyone.great production , great casting , and great cinematography . kinda relatable at some point . also enjoy the discussion about life and death . I be n\\'t invest enough with the relationship of the main character , but there be some cute moment that I really like . if I be be honest , I do n\\'t plan on watch this , but a friend of mine recommend this to I so I give it a shot . some people here be say that this series be so slow but I think it be intend consider it be a historical drama . the first episode get I hook up to the series , but then it slowly lose its magic halfway because of its repititive storyline . like even the big moment of the character \\'s backstory be very predictable for I ( especially with grim reaper ) . when it be already reveal I be like , \" meh ... \" nothing more exciting happen after that . overall , it be okay for entertainment value though . but I do n\\'t see myself rewatche this sometime this year . I keep this one off for awhile , I start get into KDramas about a year ago and I \\'ve be a huge fan of tear jerker / romantic drama . I \\'ve say it before and I have no hiccup in say it again , \" Koreans have master the art of tragic drama . \"I\\'ve see quite a few kdrama and you well believe I \\'ve shed a tear or two in some of they , not embarassed to share that at all . what can I say ? I ca n\\'t say I stumble upon this kdrama because I \\'ve always see it mention everywhere , on the kdrama subreddit that I lurk quite frequently , in kdrama relate discord etc .. but people mainly talk about it for its beautiful ost and I be here to tell you that , it be a god damn masterpiece , the OST \\'s be n\\'t overrated or unnecessarily brag about . each and every OST in this show be a spot on 10/10 - I genuinely ca n\\'t find a single flaw in it . in fact , it just complete this show . move to the cast , you really ca n\\'t get well chemistry between a male and female lead than this add to the fact that the secondary m lead and f lead be also a perfect match ! no matter what word I choose to describe the level of performance the artist have give , it would be an understatement . come to the show itself without spoil too much , damn this director for continuously have a grip on your heart through the last few episode . so very well execute , I want to hate it and love it at the same time but I can say this , it be definitely leave a mark on I . definitely go to have a Goblin hangover that be go to last for quite awhile . if you \\'ve read this far , give it a watch . do n\\'t leave it for another day . P.S - the only reason I \\'ve give a 8/10 for rewatch value be because I do n\\'t really rewatch any kdrama cause my heart would n\\'t be able to endure that much damage . it be a precaution I take for my own well being . I admit that I be pretty late to the game ( 2 year late actually ) but I \\'ve be hold off Goblin for a while and since I be currently watch Touch your heart , I decide to watch Goblin while wait for the remain episode to air . anyhow ! I love watch this drama . the character be so genuine , sincere , and wholesome . I be a huge fan of Lee DongWook as well as Yoo in Na :) the OST be absolutely amazing I be pretty sure everyone who have n\\'t watch this drama have hear of \" beautiful \" by Crush at least once before . the cinematography never fail to keep I in awe . the panning and perfectly well film shot be so captivating and make the whole drama aesthetic and beautiful . the plot go a little fast at time and they do n\\'t explain certain thing but the act and cast cover up for the small flaw . I highly suggest this drama and to those who be hesitate to watch , I be tell you : watch . this . drama . now . also , I be pretty sure you already know that this drama be n\\'t exactly your typical romcom romance drama . it be pretty darn sad . I cry at least three time in one episode so prepare some tissue . top notch cast - checkGreat music - checkDramatic ( and very well make ) background story - checkbromance - checkSecondary couple - :) chemistry between main lead - :( start watch for Gong Yoo , who be daebak as always but*SPOILER AHEAD*halfway through the series the plot become an endless loop of \\' when will the sword be take out\\'i be hope this will be resolve soon but no , it seem to become the main couple \\'s only obstacle and issueas the main couple circle endlessly around the sword - the second couple gain steam with the ring ! the meeting on the bridge ! the grim reaper try enter date scene!honestly I continue watch for the second couple instead since the main couple seem to lack spark.as the series continue , the plot thicken around the second couple and I become so invest in they that I start to skip all the scene contain the main coupletried rewatche and find that even the bromance between the goblin and the grim reaper be still more entertaining than the goblin and the bride :( conclusion : watch it for the second couple beautifully tragic story and the super fun bromance!goblin , I have be anxious to see this but could n\\'t find it but they have it under another name \" guardian :   the Lonely and great God \" .      I research both the two main lead , Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun .   I must say Gong Yoo not bad at all .   I can understand why everything that they say about you be one of Korea \\'s good actor .     well , here be my 4th good kisser !    I can understand why you say you be tired after do this movie ,   you put your heart in this one .    for a minute I think Kim Go Eun might \\'ve be too young for you but I be surely shock to know this actress be 28 year old .    she be age well , she look like a teenager .   lol      she do very well in this as well .    the other 3 main lead , in -Yoo in Na who play sunny , Yook Sung Jae who play Yoo Deok Hwa , and Lee Dong Wook who play the   grim reaper ;   this TVDrama could n\\'t be do without all of you .    you all be fantastic and great acting !    the visual effect be well do but I would \\'ve have love to have see more .    I still give it a 10 rating because of the storyline and the act performance .    the music be also very good on the ear . note :    I can hardly wait for Deng Lun remake of \" Goblin \" .     it seem like it have many remakes!goblin be a very well craft show . for most of the series it be a perfect 10 . I have to say the highlight of this series be the cinematography , act , and the witty dialogue . the two male lead actor their bromance be incredible and be my favorite part of the series . the weak part of the series be the last few episode . it feel like that the Goblin come back too easily and literally every main character die at one point in the last few episode . I wish the make the main girl a bit old . it feel weird that she be with the Goblin in high school . other than those complaint , this show be very well made and very enjoyable . ok so .. be one of my first review . first which will.be well organize at least . I have watch this drama few year back , but be still on my mind . one of my korean work colleague recommend it to I , besides Master \\'s Sun . StoryI do not find the story really original , because I have see many movie and drama , plus I read many book . but be not cliché either . somewhere in between , maybe ?   it start well , develop in a realistic pace and   do not have a rush ending . acting / Cast . quite well do with the casting . I be not really fond of any of the actor at first , cause I never see anything with they by that time . Goblin be like my second kdrama see , I think hahaha . but ! they captivate I with their character performance and I watch more of their work .   in specially the ML . he give so much emotion ? MusicAmazing ? ? ? Re - watch ? most definitely!i highly recommend it to everyone who like a supernatural romance story , with a realistic development despite the supernatural . if you like also stuff like destiny and fate ... go for it!i do not talk much about the story or character , because I do not want to spoil someone \\'s own experience , impression and understanding of the character . but I must say that Goblin and Death r like LOL ... they do make I laugh few time ... and I do not laugh easy at all when watch movie or series ? so I just finish watch and it be so overhyped that I watch it too . the show definitely be not worth the hype . it make I cringe a few time because of the female lead . I love the bromance between the grim reaper and the goblin . honestly , that be the only reason why I continue to watch it . there be definitely well Kdramas out there so this be not like one of those must - watch Kdrama .   I really like the cinematography , it be beautiful . but something do not make sense at the end too.-StoryThe story be by far one of the most unique and amazing ! the way the director make the romance / supernatural genre work and unfold   be different and introduce many interesting idea . the pacing of the story be set at a great pace to where every episode keep you fully engaged and have something truly important to add to the puzzle piece of the story . not to mention , the cinematography ! ! the shot , angle , lighting , and location all combine make the show mesmerizing and pleasing to view ! can not emphasize how aesthetically pleasing this show is!you be also take on a rollercoaster of emotion from one end of the spectrum to the other end , begin from the 1st to the last episode , so be ready ! I do n\\'t wanna say too much here!the characteristic of the story that stand out the most to I be the character development . how the main character be develop be nearly perfect . the story continuously remind you of each character value and their personal struggle to really emphasize each character \\'s moral , motivation , and feeling . because of this emphasis , you be able to gain a deep understanding of where the character be come from . another thing I enjoy about this story be the distinct persepctive it have to offer about the meaning of life and a high being . it make you question the big picture of life and the path that life can direct you . the only thing I dislike about the story be the age of characfer , Ji Eun Tak . I feel that , that age be a bit too young and make I feel somewhat uncomfortable watch the show . it keep I question myself if I could continue watch this show ( which I be glad I do ) , but I could understand why the director choose that age.-Actors / ActressesI really enjoy the actor and actress they choose ! everyone play their script incredibly and do an outstanding job in display emotion , body language , etc . , but I have to say that Lee Dong - wook \\'s acting stand out to I the most!-musicthe music in this show be definitely one of the top ! the soundtrack be super catchy and fit perfectly into this show . the timing of each soundtrack be beautifully place in the show , bring out so much more emotion in the scene ; especially in the scene where it really matter ! there be only a few song I dislike but if I be to highlight a few song , I \\'d say \" beautiful \" , \" Hush \" , \" I miss you \" , and \" Heaven\".-Rewatch ValueThe only reason why I place the rewatch value at an 8 be more of personal thing . for I , once I find out the entire story , I wo n\\'t be suprise as much anymore , mean the emotion and connection be not as strong as when I first see the show . but there still be value in re - watch because there be so much content ( as in most kdrama ) . you might be able o catch a lot of subtle thing you might \\'ve miss , pick up on a new life lesson , and/or simply re - live the emotional moment ! but would I still re - watch the show ? Definitely!So , overall , I give this show a 9/10!such a beautiful story with amazing actor and even more amazing character . I find myself laugh out loud at part and cry at other . I can see myself miss these character in a week and sneak into my room to revisit they . only thing that bother I be the story - line of the grim reaper and sunny , it felt really stretch out and I know they have a connection because of their past life but we do n\\'t see they actually get to know each other in their current one , and the fact they keep break up and get back together seem redundant . overall , I love this show and would recommend it to anyone who like a supernatural yet mundane story of love and friendship . must watch ! synopsis do not do Justice to the ShowI keep see this show pop up whenever I be look for a new show to watch . however , I keep disregard it because the synopsis do not grab my attention at all . however , I stumble upon the soundtrack of this show and I fall in love and decide to watch it . one of my great decision I make . the story be far more intricate then what the synopsis states.1 ) Love Story : both the primary and secondary love story be great . I almost like the secondary love story well than the primary2 ) the deep meaning of living and death be nicely portrayed3 ) the way the director and screenwriter write the story be amazing . there be so much happening and even the fluff between story have meaning to it that you do n\\'t think of it as fluff4 ) the the small amount of humour add be a nice touch5 ) Amazing SOUNDTRACK6 ) Bonus , the actor be super cute and the Actress play her role very wellCeritanya okey bgt walopun genrenya fantasy , , jg cm lihat sekedar khayalan yg ga mungkin . Ada lucu nya , \\xa0 romance , , pokoknya terhibur . Apalagi ada trio ganteng nya .. Komplit bgt .. Mereka bener bener kocak bgt , berharap mereka bakalan main bareng lagi buat drama di masa dpn . Kalo bs genrenya fantasy juga . Soalnya \\xa0 aku \\xa0 suka \\xa0 bgt \\xa0 drama , \\xa0 apalagi \\xa0 genre \\xa0 fantasy , \\xa0 mystery , \\xa0 detective , \\xa0 kalo \\xa0 yg \\xa0 romance \\xa0 gitu \\xa0 agak \\xa0 kurang \\xa0 ya . \\xa0 thank u?-tp rada ga suka nya , peran main cewenya .. Entah knp saat jd anak sekolahan cantik , tp pas cerita dewasa berambut pendek , keliatan jelek . Kyk lbh tua dr s goblin nya.-juga sayang bgt , cerita tentang sunny n Wangyi aka Kim Woobin nya rada sedikit . Pas endingnya itu lohh , , yg bikin rada gimana gitu .. Uri \\xa0 Sungjaenya \\xa0 kemana ? \\xa0 Yg \\xa0 mana ? \\xa0 Kok \\xa0 ga \\xa0 ada . one big reason that I be reluctant to watch this be because of the huge age gap between the actor ( which be only 12 year but still ) and the fact that in the show the goblin treat Ji Eun Tak as a child ( because she be 19 and be in high school when they begin fall in love and he be like 30 or 40 aside from the fact that he be hundred of year old ) he also call her child and I feel like in that situation it be more like a father - daughter relationship and it just feel kinda weird . sometimes it be n\\'t that way and if I ignore the fact that be much old then this couple would be pretty cute and funny . I originally want to watch this show because there be lot of video with clip from this show and it be so funny so I want to try watch it . and because I have school so I do n\\'t have as much time during the day to watch it so I spend my night watch and let I tell you it be worth it . I really want to watch it again even though I just finish it , but I kinda do n\\'t wanna go through the same tear again . some part make I so emotional and sad and I have to cry and the acting be so freaking good . the character be sometimes super immature but it be entertaining to watch . the music be also pretty good because while I be brush my tooth I sometimes catch myself singe the lyric of the opening song of the show . overall I really enjoy the show and the ending be enough for I to sleep well so I \\'ll just end it here and find another drama to watch . I first hold off the drama for a few month even though I know it be one of the most popular kdrama of all time . but I decide to watch it and it be amazing . I regret not watch early . the acting and the music be my favorite part . everything in the drama be well write and direct . the bromance be so good too . and most of the event make sense and I be able to understand why they occur and how . I watch this 2 time . once myself and once with my mom . I enjoy it both time and get excite and hype up .   my mom do n\\'t know Korean ( I only know a little tiny bit ) and we be watch with japanese sub cause it be my mom \\'s first language but my mom have a little hard time understand what be happen and I have to explain it to she . but anyway , I recommend you watch this drama . I really enjoy this show , it be entertaining , rarely drag and it keep the viewer invest in the story . what I like about this show : Gong Yoo be my bias so whenever he be a drama I be blind by this actor and his amazing talent . even so , he do a really good job portray a tortured , eccentric immortal that want to end his existence once and for all . the entire cast do an amazing job and I do not believe that this drama be overhype . what I do not like : I do n’t want to put a spoiler here , but there be something about korean Dramas that have a similar ending that I just can not enjoy . I give all drama prop for not use this textbook like end , unfortunately this drama end in such a way that make I sigh with disappointment ... but overall it be still a good watch . I do re - watch this ... so it do have an amazing re - watch value , consider I never like to glance at drama twice . and the music be amazing and I have it on my place list for a couple year now . I have some hesitation about watch this as be n\\'t sure I \\'d like I \\'d like the fantasy side of this .   boy be I wrong!Goblin , or Guardian : the Lonely and great God be a brilliant love story across the age . the all start cast be superb head up by Gong Yoo ( train to Busan ) and the delightful Kim Go Eun .   their dynamic be perfect . the second lead of Lee Dong Wook and Yoo in Na be brilliant as well . if like I , you have reservation about a fantasy style drama , put they to one side and watch this drama .   you wo n\\'t regret it .   my heart however , really do it - it actually ache in certain scene / episode but I think Goblin be a right of passage for a kdrama fan and especially like I , you be new to this genre . it be not perfect however - for the reason give above re heart pain - i\\'v e mark it down on rewatchability but do n\\'t let that put you off .   I be a big softy . secondly , let \\'s talk about product placement - it be hilarious but annoy some people .   I do n\\'t mind but it be the most obvious I \\'ve see in al the drama \\'s I \\'ve watch . all in all - watch and enjoy .   with hindsight I should n\\'t have binge it in a few day - no wonder my heart hurts!This be in my top three favorite drama .   the OST have so many great song and I listen to it on Spotify a lot . the Grim / Goblin bromance be highly entertaining and bring depth to the character . they have such good chemistry that you feel like you be part of the drama . the sunny / grim story line be one of my favorite . the character be lovable , quirky , and sometimes socially awkward . if you want to see more from these two actor together watch \" touch your heart \" , it do n’t have the same emotional intensity as this drama but it be still a good watch . Secretary Kim dance and singe to BTS & EXO in front of grandpa be hilarious . in many drama this character would turn on everyone but I be glad to see that the character have unconditional loyalty to the Goblin . Kim Go Eun have so much energy in her high school character that it be make I tired watch she . kudo to her make up artist and stylist that be able to make she look 10 year old and different from her high school character . she be able to tone down the energy but you still feel her passion . Gong Yoo , what can I say about this fabulous actor . watch the extra , they will show you how fun and serious about his craft he be . I love when they be in the movie theater and they be watch \" train to Busan \" and he comment about the decline of korean cinema . I laugh a little too hard when sunny be describe the Goblin to the medium and she say \" Gong Yoo . \" it ’ these kind of \" inside \" joke in drama that I finally get after watch so many of they . i’m give this drama 10 star because there be character development and growth , the storyline be easy to follow and do n’t have any blare \" jump the shark \" moment . the OST add to the drama and do n’t distract the viewer from the story line . this may get some thumb down but I ’m go to say that the lack of PDA for this drama be a plus . there be a lot of look of yearning but little physical contact until their relationship progress . when there be kiss , its not a slow burn it ’ like strike a match , quick and heated . I do n’t feel like I ’m be pander to . overall there be little to dislike unless you do n’t like the genre , otherwise I highly recommend you watch it now!OMG , this happen to I twice with reply 1988 and weightlift fairy , I ca n\\'t think about anything else . the first time I watch this show , I be like 14 and I do n\\'t enjoy it . but now at 16 and more into dramaworld , this show be in my top 5 . the storyline be awesome . the controversy of the show ,   about the age gap ,   like think about it , he be 900 year old , no one can be old enough to be with he , so stop low rating because of that . the visual be amazing too , the budget be really big , just guess but WOW.Don’t miss this drama . it ’ unbelievably good and entertaining . bring out emotional side of you . it make u laugh , cry and scream in surprise . you will rewatch certain scene guarantee . LikedCast : Goblin and grim reaper be my favourite character of all time . so be credit card boy . they make u laugh so hard . even goblin bride be innocent and sweet . the small character be so accomplished and good with their acting . goblin sister in past life , Eun Tak \\'s childhood friend , Grim Reaper \\'s junior though they be on screen for short time they have cast good actor for it to make sure they do a good job . story : exciting and funny with up down like never see before . to avoid spoiler I wo n’t add much . the flow be smooth and very well present and execute . over all : a masterpiece indeed . the music , the act , storyline , direction everything be too good . my only dislike be second lead actress cause I feel goblin sister in past life be play by a much accomplished actress and I wish they continue her role .This be my first korean drama , after watch many chinese drama . this show be simply beautiful ,   top to bottom : concept , story , writing , act , cinematography , music .   it be a wild , emotional ride . partly a historical drama , but mostly modern .   it make you think differently about death and the different stage of life . maybe it be because of this be my first Kdrama and it be more common there , but I actually love the mixture of different religion .   the secondary couple be just as great as the primary couple . this be so , so well write . bring tissue . okay so Goblin have be sit on my to watch list for a long time . I just , I dunno . it never grab I . I finally take the plunge to watch it . I love the acting and humor they have in the series . but to I , this be n\\'t the good KDrama I \\'ve see . story be good , but the first half be kinda boring minus all the funny bit of the Goblin , Reaper and \" nephew\" . I would recommend to watch , but I doubt it will be a KDrama I \\'ll ever watch again . good cast , great song and good story line . but yet like I say , the first half be boring . I dunno why , but it be . comment on this if you watch it from my review :) Goblin be the first korean drama that I actually watch while it be still on - go . I remember how I wait patiently every week for new episode to come out . yes , this drama be really that good , it make someone like I who be n\\'t into fantasy drama fall hard for this series ... either that or maybe the charm of Gong Yoo ? or maybe the flow of its story line ? or maybe the dry humor that be actually funny ? or maybe the whole mortal and immortal love thing ... I be not sure ... but somehow they all mix together and it create an awesome drama series . any how , if I really think about it , even to this day I still do n\\'t like this type of fantasy drama but somehow Goblin be still on my top 5 most favorite korean drama . it have be more than three week since Goblin end and I do not know what keep I from write the drama review for so long . I have follow this drama most ardently even go to the extent of sit up late at night to watch the drama within a few hour of its telecast . Goblin be a smashing hit in Korea and all over Asia . I be glad that , for once , Koreans and foreign viewer have love and appreciate the same drama at the same time . for I , this drama be like the perfect coffee where everything be add in the right quantity just like the way I would like it . comedy , romance , suspense , anguish , and action be so perfectly blend that I do not find this remarkable drama lack in any department . let ’s weigh the Lonely shine Goblin on our show beam balance and see what makes then show a praise - worthy , must watch drama . good WeightsRollicking Comedy : Goblin be high on emotion and relationship but it be not short on comic scene . comedy scene in the show be perform earnestly that it have to elicit rollicking laughter . be it the grim reaper and the goblin ’s banter or Eun Tak ’s innocent demand from the goblin or Deok Hwa ’s unreasonable need , everything be hilarious . in a drama mostly depict human value , the reasonable dosage of comedy provide the much - need edge to the show . bromance : though the romance on the show be decent it be the \\' bromance \\' between goblin and the grim reaper that steal the show . I have not see two male actor share such an easy yet fiery chemistry on - screen for a long time . their banter and fight be hilarious . it break my heart to see they hate each other for a brief period towards the end because I really enjoy see they together . perfect Cast : I have to say that the experienced cast on the show do a phenomenal job towards make the show what it be . the sincerity with which the cast perform be evident on - screen and the result be well - deserve . even the support cast look convincing in their role . the casting of this show be one of the good I have see in Kdramas . Magical music : the show ’s music be simply enchanting . in fact , the OST title \\' Round and Round \\' become such a big hit with the viewer that the show maker have to officially release it even when the producer have no intention of keep it in the original album . of all the song on the show \\' stay with I \\' and \\' Round & Round \\' be my most favourite song . bad WeightsViewers may find loophole in the story but as far as I be concern those minor little thing do not bother I a bit . the overall content be so stupendous that I have no complaint whatsoever . I give the Lonely Shining Goblin 4.8 out 5 rating . I have never give any drama this high mark till date ( not even my most favourite drama ) but Goblin deserve such high mark as it excel in every department be its story , screenplay , cast , direction , music and every single thing that complete this drama . I personally vouch for this drama . do not miss Goblin for anything . go and watch it now . originally post on Alphagirl.in . Goblin be the great K - Drama the world have ever see . one can never forget this series , if he have watch it . do n\\'t worry about the hate review , just jump into the story . after finish this one , you will be in deep thought about it over one month . the great story be mix with overly talented actor and actress . Gong Yoo , one of the good actor , mix with Lee Dong Wook create immense pleasure and bring humour to the whole plot . it be see that there be some plot hole , but truly speak , it be not worth talk about it . if you have n\\'t watch Goblin , you will surely repent after watch all those other boring k - drama . surely it be the most popular k - drama internationally . so you should give it a try . afterlife story , compensation for worldly crime , life learn lesson mix with lovely ever romance between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun will be amazing to watch . this drama be good in every sense . great graphic , great story , great cast , great ost , great cinematography . well than any other korean drama you have watch so far . Gong Yoo , portray as Goblin ( Kim Shin ) could n\\'t have be well . I do n\\'t know how they choose cast but no one could have be well than Gong Yoo as the Goblin . the line be way too emotional and his acting be too perfect . every moment he be in the drama shine . his story of so many year and his previous tragedy will shake you to the peak of excitement . vastly experienced Gong Yoo hit the hot spot again . one of the highest pay actor of Korea of all time and most popular actor of all time . Kim Go Eun , Ji Eun Tak , a girl with the ability to see ghost mean to be Goblin \\'s Wife , play charming and amazing part . everybody , literally every body say so many bad thing about she and the drama for choose she and make she so young . but truly , she have prove everyone wrong in the good possible way . the way she act , feel like one of the great actress of all time . Lee Dong Wook , the Greatest Interest of the show , combine with Gong Yoo by create mesmerising Bromance , play the most difficult role of grim Reaper and OMG , he be so great as grim Reaper . the walk scene of he and Gong Yoo literally make everyone \\'s heart flutter . though he play support actor but he be not a support actor rather one of the highest pay actor of all time in Korea . Yoo in Na , play Kim Sun , come as a support actress in the drama . same go for she , always select as a main lead . this be a big reason the drama be hit . four of the good cast be massive to see at a time . Yoo in Na \\'s acting be up to the mark and she portray her character so well . it be really great to see . yeah , that sum up the review . watch this amazing k - drama . even if you create a vote poll for the good drama ever compare with dot , my love from the star , you will still see Goblin beat everyone . that show how maximum people appreciate it . do n\\'t just see the hate comment otherwise it would n\\'t get 9.0 rating in total . give it a go . thank you so much for read . when I got invest into KPop properly last year , I start to invest my time into a few KDramas . Goblin be one of the drama that I see around as it be know as one of the most phenomenal drama , but have n\\'t watch it until now . as I know this drama be one of the good , I do have high hope that it would be an amazing one , and I be here to say , this drama be now my favourite drama of all timefirst of all , I would like to give credit to the writer for such an incredible storyline . I be not really into watch stuff about supernatural creature , but this drama make I very intrigued about the supernatural being and it be for sure interesting to learn about Goblins and Grim Reapers .   the writer do a splendid job with connect the story of the character with their past lifetime and their strategic plan of piece everything together . from my perspective , it be a very original storyline . Gong Yoo play as Kim Shin / Goblin be mesmerising . since watch this drama , I have develop a crush on he . he be get such a tender smile that could light up the entire universe . every scene be such a treat . every piece of happiness he get , the sadness and the laugh , all of those be portray so well for his character . so sweet , loveable , yet a past that be so unfortunate . it be also worth mention that I also fall in love with he because of his boyfriend / husband material : classy in style , funny , cute and a bit of a goofball . Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak be super cute and adorable . a lot of people find she annoying , but I find her behavior justifiable , but it really depend on how you look from it . her character do n\\'t really bother I at all , I love her character and her development . Lee Dong Wook as Grim Reaper / Wang Yeo be a bit frightening due to his lack of expression haha , but I be really draw into his character . I have never sympathise with a character just as much as he . such a huge puppy in this drama and the good \\' crier \\' I have see yet . I love all the cast , they portray their character really well , amazing acting and I never wish for anyone different . the story be amazing . the love story be phenomenal and story . not only that , but the bromance between the Goblin and Grim Reaper be epic , I find myself ship they more than the real lover at time aha . the story will definitely leave you drown in your own tear , but will certainly make your heart flutter and internally scream . it be funny , sad , beautiful , romantic , tragic , heartbreaking ... the music for this drama be good , some of the song be not really my cup of tea , but all of they be perfect for this drama . I be glad that they use Round and Round for the intro , dramatic , yet so mysterious . beautiful by Crush , stay with I and Round and Round be my main favourite . I find myself ponder on if I should rewatch this series again even though I just finish watch it . this be the first KDrama where I have thought on rewatche every single episode again from the very beginning . I be go to hold back for now , but I will certainly rewatch this again to relive those moment and find the time frame at where certain scene happen . definitely recommend this drama , it be worth watch . you know when a drama be good when you feel every emotion that the character be feel . it will certainly take I a long while to move on from this drama , if not I do n\\'t think I ever willI love the story line of this show . it be very unique and captivating to get any person to love this show . the chemistry with all of the character / actor be just one of a kind . from main lead to second lead , both actor be able to have a chemistry that be sweet and respectful . although , the main lead love interest start as a 19 year old . there be no appropriateness with it . the only complaint be that there be no true villain .   soundtrack be sweet and easy listening , although it be very repetitive . it be still catchy . I would recommend this series to anyone that be new to watch k drama . I wache the 1 episode and be so hard to continue I stop and then I decide to see it until episode 3 and I loved.-i do n\\'t like Kim Go Eun that much ... but her role be not bad .. neh .. -I fall in love with Lee Dong Wook , he be amazing and put the drama something not \" boring\"-The bromance ! >.< so cute . make the drama even well and their relationship be beautiful.-sungjae ! ! ! ! ! ! I love he , but I never see a drama with he , however he be perfect here.-I actually love more the second couple ( grim Reaper and sunny ) then the main , just because be so funny and sweet . see the grim Reaper confuse with love relationship be the good xd- \" sunny not Sun Hee \" this will be in my mind - the OST ... incredible , so soft and sweet in the right moments.-The Director and Writer be like legend I really like both of they - the ending be so realistic and make I cry > ///<anyway it be a good Fantasy / romance drama , with very good comedy and relationship . best drama I have ever see , hand down ! I can not even explain how I feel after the last episode , so many emotion all together ! this show really play with my feelings!every single episode be worth watch , it just keep get well ! the way the show be write be pure genius ! there be no flaw with this show , I never want to take my eye off the screen because I be so intrigued . it be a perfectly dramatic , hilarious and be a beautiful   show . there be no word that can explain how perfect it be . you will fall in love right away with the every main and side character . the cinematography and the acting be beyond anything I have ever seen!something that many people have a problem with about this show be the age gap ! but let I just say it be basically like Edward and Bella from twilight . I be also someone who be a little annoyed by it , but as time go by my worry completely go away . the chemistry between Kim Shin ( goblin ) and Ji Eun - Tak ( goblin bride )   be the pure thing I have ever see ! I be really worried I would not like they together , but please give it a chance ! a few more scene you will be in love with they as I did!without spoil   anything , let I just say ...... grim & sunny and GOBLIN & JI EUN - TAK be the FRIKIN CUTEST ! I hope they be live happily in comfort . I really can not express how good this show be . the perfect fusion of fantasy and contemporary , with strong script - writing that allow for well - pace plot progression and stable character growth and characterisation . all the positive be back up by a cast of hyper - competent actor who seem to be perfect match for their role , and a soundtrack compose by god herself . definitely the drama I would recommend to first - time watcher . more than just a romance , the story also focus on the importance of family , the one that you have through blood and birth , but also the one that you make for yourself . perhaps my favourite part of the drama be outside of the amazingly write romance portion , fantasy segment and action part , but the small in - between where a family that consist of a lonely Goblin , his greedy nephew , a grim Reaper , and a teenage girl get to behave as a family , and eat meal together , tease each other and share advice . they say that every book you read , every person you meet and every place you visit take something from you and leave something else in return . that ’ how I feel about this drama . it ’ the good way I can put into word how I feel about it . first , let I start by give a little background of my experience with Goblin before watch it : when it come out , everyone be freak out about it . I remember it all too well … the youtube video , fan art , twitter discussion … I do n’t know why but I initially think I would never , in this life , watch it and love it as much as they . maybe because I be fairly new to this world and be scared of drama with historical reference ? or do I think it be too complicated for I to understand what be go on ? be I scared because the actor be a bit old than what I be use to ? I do n’t know , but I simply decide that it be not for I . year go by . one day , a few week ago , I be scroll down a thread on twitter about funny drama moment and they include a scene from Goblin and I think \" maybe I should give it a try . \" but end up brush it off . but a few day later after that , I be on dramatist read the article and casually read the \" most popular \" list . Goblin be ( be ) there . and suddenly I got this urge to watch it immediately as if my life depend on IT ! and so I do . the destin be a real thing , guy . anyways , back to the REVIEWUsually , I review each part of the drama , start with the plot , but for some reason I ’m not strong enough to write a full review today . maybe after I rewatch it ( because that will certainly happen ) . there ’ plenty to talk about : the engaging and beautiful- even if painful- plot , the splendid acting and cast who portray unforgettable character , the good OST of all time , the relieving feeling it leave behind when it ’ over . I feel like everyone go through so much that I just want they to have an ending- at some point I think a happy ending be impossible for they . the dialogue be absolutely incredible . you cry and laugh like crazy in less than 5 minute . the friendship in these are- oh my god . the first episode be the good episode of a drama I ’ve ever watch . like , honestly , the first 20 minute of the first episode make I cry because of how good those scene be . and I feel the need to write a live commentary of I watch the rest of the episode , which be a first for I . so here it be , my reaction to the first episode , write by I on Sunday , March 10th 2019://commentaryepisode 1 - so … I just watch the first 20 minute . literally the good twenty minute of any drama I ’ve ever watch . the war be … mind - blow , I ca n’t describe what I feel . the acting be insane . no word . simply no word . and now I want to learn all about korean history ( even more than before ) . Great.-27 minute in and this little boy make I laugh soooo hard . \" why be you speak informally to my grandpa ? do you want to die ? \" hahaha so cute-48:00 … my heart be break . will I be able to deal with this drama ? I do n’t think so . I be dead . I ’m literally dead . this be my ghost write this.-this be go to make my top 5 list , be n’t it?//yes , yes it be . this show will stay very high on my list for a long time , I can feel it . so refreshing . I know what would happen to Goblin because I have see many reference to it on social medium and basically everywhere ? but nothing could have prepare I for that scene . it be my first time watch the whole scene and I sob . and then I be happy . I be so happy by the last episode . and then- oh well , we suffer along with the character , do n’t we ? but I would n’t change a thing . by the way , now that I ’m think about that , a sequel would n’t hurt anyone , would it ? it would make perfect sense if it be well write … but the perfection that be Goblin should n’t be change . it should just stay as it be and nothing more than that . i’m so thankful for this drama because I be able to finally get over my prejudice of historical drama ( only if we only get a glimpse of it , I ’m more confident and comfortable to watch one of those because I find out I can really love the story even if I ’m scared of the genre ) and of drama I think I would never watch if my life . what an irony . and maybe I \\'ll give Descendants of the Sun a try too ! I ’m happy that ( at last ) I know why so many people adore this drama back then and would n’t shut up about it and why it remain among so many people ’s favorite . I get it . the actor be amazing ( both male and female actor ! ! ! ) and we will all love they eternally . I get it . and I have decide to write only a short review with an impactful ( and very pretentious ) statement but I end up rant about it . oh well , I regret nothing . what can I say about this drama .... many would say this be a masterpiece and I agree with that . I have always for some reason find reason to not watch this cause even without read the description of the drama I have a feeling it would be a tragedy I have a feeling I would cry many bucket of tear , but after let ’s say 2 month I finally get the courage to watch it .... and as soon as I start I be ADDICTED the start be just amazing the story straightaway start with something that captivate the viewer completely I wo n’t say what happen since this be n’t one of those review that contain spoiler . although this drama use cgi it be n’t exaggerated or maybe it be just really well do I mean that ship scene damn .... usually some fantasy drama use cgi so much that the whole drama look fake and I mean it ’ fantasy obviously it will be fake but it get to a certain point where it ’ almost cringey but this drama be not like that . the actor do an amazing job they convey the character so well and they have so much chemistry in the drama and in the bts , I think we really have to give the actor an applause for their cry scene cause honestly every time they cry I feel it , I remember there be a part that Kim Go Eun cry ( she play Ji Eun Tak ) and her cry sound to melancholy and so real the way she gasp for air I myself just could n’t stop cry with she . there be also many time the actor improvise themselves try to make the scene funny or more correspondent to their character they just do an amazing job!The Director , the film crew , the scriptwriter , the cgi group and oh my god the makeup crew that deserve a huge applause the way they make a young person look old with makeup be just amazing , they do 5 hour of make up on just one person I feel bad for the actress that have to come 5 hour early just to get her makeup do . the music be also very well choose they make some scene so much more emotional or some so much more romantic it be just amazing . overall I give the   drama a 10/10   they do fantastic with practically everything I hope my review persuade you to watch this drama and let I warn you about the tear that will just flow out of your eye , I hope your ready ! and if your wonder about the ending .... it be bitter sweet . what have already not be say about this show ? I be expect to be disappoint by it as there be too much hype around this drama and that always lead to a rise in expectation . however after complete it , I can say that I totally understand the hype but not without its issue . I will start with the good:-honestly at the heart of the show be the bromance between the Goblin and the grim Reaper . they have a definite backstory and a connection that we see blossom as the two rely on each other and grow fond of one another.-Grim reaper . yes . that be it . with the most interesting character arc , all the plot line surround he be the most engaging and I would always look forward to his scenes.-The romance between sunny and the Grim Reaper be heartbreaking and endearing . they have great chemistry   and I could totally see why Touch your heart be make after this show.-strong support cast that add to the drama instead of work as an unnecessary filler . each character have something to add in their own way.-The humorous part be well - place and would help bring a light tone after heavy scenes.-OST . the show be know to have a great soundtrack and it honestly contribute in make this drama better.-spot on act by each member of the cast.-last but not definitely not the least , its outstanding cinematography . the color and location be just super pleasing to the eye . there be certain illogical point in the plotline but I wo n\\'t include any plot - relate point in my dislike area . now come to my share of problems:-the MAIN couple . just like a few other have mention , the age gap here be very hard to ignore . and no , I be not refer to the age gap between the actor ; the fact that a 900 + year old Goblin fall for a high school student just do not sit well with I . their relationship at many point seem more like a father - daughter duo , with he pat her head , buy her gift as she squeak and get excite , tell she to be back home early and on time , pay for she meals- the list just go on . it certainly do not help that Eun Tak be write as an innocent , bubbly young teenager and the \\' wise \\' Goblin too lose all his   composure around she . the actor of course nail their part so this be not on they but just on how the central love story be write . even till the end , the weak link for I be their romance plot line . they do have their moment , but that leave a very temporary smile on my face unlike the second couple.-repeate scenario , too many flashback and heck lot of slow motion shot ( particularly between the Goblin and Eun Tak ) . I know all drama have these , but this one take it to another level.-lack of screen time for Yoo Duk Hwa and sunny . these be two very interesting character which in spite of be a part of the main cast be underutilize in my opinion.-a lot of the essential and heavy stuff be reveal and give light to after episode 10 ( with early episode have repeat scenario and flashback as mention above).one might wonder in spite of not enjoy the main romance   how could the rating still be an 8 ? well even with my personal problem with it , there be many factor that keep I go and I be invest in the show . I be also very pleased with how the show end . if you want to watch , give it a try . but if the main couple \\'s interaction bother you in the start , it do not get well . if you can get past it , then there be the epic bromance and the second lead \\'s love story . if the romance fit your bill , then the show will be extremely enjoyable for you . athis one be my most fav drama ... I love Gong yoo and lee dong wook \\'s acting ... its truly amazing even yoo in haa and kim go eun be one of the good actress ... the storyline be good and the music be truly mesmerizing ... I be totally innlove of theis drama ... its a must watch if you be a drama lover .. 😍 🥰 🤩 it have comedy , tragedy , romance , terror and all kind of emotion ... you will fall in love with Kim shin ... you will feel pity .. you will feel happy .. you will feel content by the end of the drama .. so go for it .. this drama be amazing!!!!!I first hope that there would be more romance but later on understand that this drama could n\\'t get more perfect even if it try .     it make I laugh , cry , think , relate , clap my hand and so much more . Goblin be rlly the definition of lonely and Eun Tak be rlly the good thing that happen to he . sunny and Reaper be also rlly amazing . sunny be an amazing friend and sister and Reaper have the good character arc . I love the bromance and all the side stories!I also rlly like the friendship Eun Tak have later on with the class rep ! ! relly cute . Deok Hwa , his grandpa , and assistant Kim be also a bonus < 3this drama be a classic even tho it come out a few year ago . I love the so unpredictable end even tho it leave I with question . ( how many life do they have , why do he come back for a long period even tho the contract say \" every first snow / rain etc \" , will he always look young while she age and die and then gets reborn again ? hmmmmm).although I have a headache ( cuz I cry too much ) , I be so satisfied by the emotion the drama bring me.everything be great : act , music , script , ... except for the story . I think there be some plot hole but ca nt tell clearly bcs they will be spoiler . some scene be too cheesey :( final episode move really fast I get a little bit tired.however , love all the cast ! ! ! there s nothing to say about gong yoo , lee dongwook , yoo inna . they be excellent already . but I be so so surprised by yook sungjae and kim goeun . look forward to their next films!!now I m go to continue \\' touch your heart \\' , watch it last year but drop at the 10th episode bc of lose interest . really excited!BEST , most brilliant , amazing korean drama hand down ! ! ! ! ? it be my TOP FAVORITE and I wish the rating option be high than ten because this show be the best ever , like ever ! Kim Shin be the most dreamy person alive . the bromance with he and the grim reaper be the most adorable thing . I think every person in the world should watch this because hand down it be the best BEST best . the OST , the visual , the plot , the twist and turn , OMG just watch it now you will laugh , CRY , and think about this one for the rest of your life and every night before you go to sleep you will still think about that tunnel scene with KIM SHIN and the grim reaper bye!the experience I get after watch this drama ca n\\'t be express in word .   it be one of the good drama I ever watch . first time I feel that it look like an ordinary periodical love story and be not interested in it . but after read the plot I give it try that s all . but   overall it be a worth watch for I because this drama make I cry after the finale episode . the lead actor do their job perfectly . Goblin bride & grim Reaper and lover their romance be awesome .. it be a slow pace drama so the length may be an issue for some viewer ... but be ok with it . u also give it a try . you will defenetly fall in love with all character and also the plotI think this be my all - time favorite Kdrama . first off , the story be phenomenal . I always give drama 10 minute to see if it \\'ll hook I . if it do n\\'t , for the most part , I \\'ll have a hard time finish it for some reason . within minute , I already know I would love this Kdrama . the casting be spot - on . I ca n\\'t think of another person who could play the grim Reaper as well as   Lee Dong Wook or Gong Yoo as the Goblin . the dry humor and bromance between the two be what I enjoy the most .   none of the character \" bug \" I . not a one . in almost every drama , one character will rub I the wrong way . instead , in this drama , every character become important to I . the two separate love story complement each other so well . you root for both and there be no jealousy or game that you usually see in other drama . the emotional feeling be n\\'t force like in a lot of other drama , where you feel like they set it up just to make you cry . in this drama , there be heartbreak , but many feel - good moment . a great balance . the music be great and I feel the choice of the song be spot - on . great production as well . it do n\\'t matter who I recommend this show to , whether it be male or female , old or young , they have all enjoy it . I highly recommend this if you \\'ve never see it . I wish I see this soon . when this korean drama be air , I be interested in the first episode . I could not take my eye off the wonderfully scene . watch each new episode I feel like at the cinema , special effect and show the story be well than many movie that I have the opportunity to see . this drama remarkably show the thread how the fate of many people can interlace with each other over many year . music reflect every scene correctly . thank to she , you could feel a lot more emotion and feel the same as the actor . if you like korean drama with a fantasy story , you should watch it . if you \\'ve just stumble upon this drama , I would advise to instantly watch it . if you think you would find a comment that do n\\'t have all 10 star , it do n\\'t exist . OST - can I just say , * it be perfect * I cry everytime I hear a song from goblin , either nostalgia or just because song be so good . you should definitely check the song separately . acting - I like main character act , it be light hearted and she be a cutie . she deliver the innocence , and maturity at the same time . the male lead act be great as well , but I mean it be Gong Yoo . I also love the Grim Reapers act , cold yet cute . plot - it be really good , with many romance plot yet mystery and tragedy . side plot be also great . the plot will make you happy yet cry at the same time . I ca n\\'t tell you how many time I hear I need to watch this show , but from some stupid reason , I keep put it off . why ? I dunno . I be dumb ? lol . either way , of course once I start . I literally could n\\'t stop . to say I be go to remember this show until my last breath will be a understatement . trust I when I say if this show have catch your eye but you be still like \" eh \" .... just watch IT ! ! ! ... right now . it be so amazing!If anyone want to see my full review , feel free to check out my blog post ^_^ ( link be in my profile)There be no doubt that Korea still hold a major position in drama in Asia in spite of the rise of China in this industry .   this story be very interesting and well - develop - with the story span across century .   the twist in the story be unexpected and very craftily weave .   the two lead actor be good look .   good look actor and actress often help . in comparison to chinese drama , the male character in korean drama tend to be more chauvinistic in behaviour .   this may because chinese drama have be under scrutiny not to portrait certain value or indeed chinese society especially in the large city have become a lot more receptive to woman \\'s status in the society . the english title of this drama , however , be very poorly translate .   a goblin be an ugly dwarf - like creature .   but the lead character be handsome and tall - a complete mismatch .   wonder whether the translator know this . a well title could be immortal , Demi - god , burden of the Past or the like of these.10/10 a beautifully create drama ! ! ! I stop watch k - drama a few year back , because I lose interest in they , however I recently watch Goblin as it be recommend to I , and wow it probably be one of the only k - drama out there which do n\\'t bore I at all . every episode keep persuade I to watch the next , it have an interesting storyline with beautiful cinematography pair with an incredible OST that fit well with the scene , effectively heighten the emotion deliver . it be definitely worth the hype and rating it receive . the casting for Goblin be perfect , I fall in love with all the main character ( and the actor / actress play they ) . I believe the general idea of Eun Tak and Kim Shin \\'s relationship be to portray they as a married couple / destine lover ( the Goblin and the bride ) which I immediately notice through episode 1 , through Gong Yoo and go Eun \\'s chemistry . they deliver that \\' marry couple \\' chemistry really well , never once falter and keep it consistent through every episode . not one main character lose my interest , they be all deliver beautifully by a lovable cast and I thoroughly enjoy their presence . overall , for those who have yet to watch Goblin , I highly recommend watch it ! ! I finish it a few day ago and it be still in my mind . I do n\\'t think I can ever move on from Goblin , it be that perfect and it \\'ll mostly likely stay with I forever . it be definitely worth watch , particularly during winter , and be prepared to fall for Gong Yoo and the other ! my top no.1 drama so far , and a definite re - watch!!!Goblin be just everything you want in a kdrama . you probably read all the amazing review about how beautiful it be so i;m not go to repeat anything . Goblin be   a 10 for sure and just kinda perfect but also at the same time I have my few opinion . and here they areage difference   ( very controverial)- the age difference be a little weird ... but the romance be too beautiful and tragic to even look at that . I highly disagree with people who think they have no chemistry and instead have a father - daughter relationship .   Ar first I be highly weird out and disgust by the age difference but I look over it and you will to . hopefully . what be more weird be the fact that Gong Yoo look 40 10 year ago and today \\'s time as well . Koreans be usualy young look so I do n\\'t expect he to look that old for a korean but hey not every korean be young looking and so representation matter lolSECOND COUPLE- second couple do n\\'t really grow on I .   it be just there ... I would have love it if the gream reaper and goblin fall for the same girl . now how controversial and   conflicting be that ! however that would ruin the bromance and I refuse to sacrifice the most amazing bromance in the history of kdrama for that thought . MUSICTHE BESTTTTTTTTTTTTT . the best OST EVERRRRRRRRITS beyond BEAUTIFULLLLLLI LOVE the opening song and stay with MEthe opening song lyric make no sense tho lolGOBLIN deserve all the hype ! and thats ON PERIOD!I be here for the Grim Reaper and the Goblin .   they keep my attention . I love their relationship and these actor deliver . forewarn , the main female character be a bit too much initially- I understand it be due to her age ( she be a teenager ) . I love this actress , even though I do not love her character . I feel the actress do a great job at portray a very young girl , I just find the girl off put . that just I . but please please please , get your tissue because when this actress deliver her tragic moment- JESUS , MARY and JOSEPH , she rip the tear from the depth of my soul . I see this clip before and still be not ready . the connection and storyline be well write . the CINEMATOGRAPHY ! ! ! the SCENERY ! ! ! yessssssss . I recommend this drama . I have to address something that people be point out as a flaw ; the age gap . I be go to start by say that I be not typically a fan of age gap romance at all , but I feel like there be a purpose in Goblin for the age and the writer do a great job with their relationship development .   they do n\\'t do anything illegal in term of intimacy while she be 19 - they have one peck when she try pull out the sword . they do n\\'t kiss again until she be 20 and they do n\\'t go far than that until she be 29 ( if we go off of implication ) . yes , when she be 19 , Kim Shin admit that she be his first love , but why be that inappropriate when she would age and he would n\\'t ? you have to remember that he be essentially stick at the same physical age and his love one all age around he . and if she be fate to be his true love , he will love she at any age . from young to old . in addition to that , the love he feel for she be n\\'t just about romance . plus , the reason she be 9 , 19 , and 29 be because of the whole \\' 9 \\' thing in the show , so she could n\\'t be slightly old or young than 19 at the age they meet .   I think I would have have problem with the age gap if they kiss properly ( or go far ) while she be still a minor , but they do n\\'t because this series be about their fated true love and how they \\'ll always meet . it be a beautiful story of their sad love and life . age be n\\'t really in the equation . story : I love the entire story . it keep my attention so that I be never bored - despite the episode be long . the writing be amazing most of the time . I laugh , smile , squeal , cry , and even get scare by that asshole evil soul who shall not be name . plus , I love the fantasy and supernatural theme of the show . it have all the right ingredient to make I fall in love with the drama : romance , fantasy , supernatural , comedy , angst , find family and bromance . the development between Wang Yeo and Kim Shin honestly bring I to tear . ugh . anyway , the last four episode kind of bring down the rating for I a little because everyone be take turn die or leave . but , it do make sense for the show . all the character be great too , there be n\\'t a single one I hate . act / cast : incredible acting from the entire cast . although I love Gong Yoo and he play his role perfectly , I feel like he would have be well suit for the role 5 year beforehand . music : perfect . rewatch value : if I have time , I might rewatch this . overall : I highly recommend watch this if you have n\\'t yet . it really be such a good drama . one of the good drama and I think everyone agree with this . the production be so good , the story be compelling and it will really hook you up , I be never a fan of fantasy drama that be why I watch this year after release but this open my door to watch some drama with fantasy element . my highlight of the film be Eun Tak \\'s acting , her acting feel so real most of the time especially with the sad scene , I also love Sunny \\'s character and how can we talk about Goblin without the OST ? the OST of this drama alone be so good especially stay and beautiful Life . seriously ... what be this ? I mean , I think I \\'d be open for any type of genre , but this genre be seriously really weird . I ca n\\'t live in a realistic world , and then all of a sudden enjoy a drama about goblin and these thing . sometimes I just think to myself that some drama have high rating because of the famous actor in it , and less about the story . terrible story this be I think . just my opinion , I actually even drop it after 5th episode . if you want to watch realistic and(or ) brilliant drama with good story then I recommend gem such as Tunnel , defendant , Ghost and these thing . these be the real deal , u hear what be say . be so cba with this goblin drama . the real goblin here be the writer . this drama be now my number 1 favourite out of all I have watch . I \\'ve get to say , it be go to be pretty hard to top this one . I finish watch the last wo episode on Viki and I love it . the character , the music ( my favourite be I Miss you and Round and Round ) and the the plot be phenomenal ! I have a hard time not cry when the sad part be on ( not go to spoil ) and have a hard time not smile when they be happy . the ending be good , some people think it could \\'ve be well but I think it be sweet and everything be perfect ! ! my favourite be kill I heal I and Angry Mom but Goblin take the lead!!I will definitely rewatch this because I miss the character so much , even after 15 minute from see they lol . I recommend this to anyone who like drama as be be funny , romantic and have some action ! it also teacher a lot of lesson and put other people \\'s life into perspective . thank you so much to the writer as this be my favourite and now I have high expectation xd10/10it take I a while to watch this because of my busy schedule . usually I would feel tired and stress , and seriously this have keep I up and about!I always look forward to the next episode . it entail all kind of emotion . comedic , really uplift my day . heart wrench as well , every moment be well connected . I really love it , and I think that they make a good match despite the age difference!don\\'t hesitate guy , just watch it ! I do n\\'t even watch the trailer , nor know anything about it , I just go on and watch it ! and I really love it ! kuddo to the writer , which have the same one as \" Descendants of the sun \" and \" The Heirs \" . it be really nice“Goblin : the Lonely and great God \" which air from December 02 , 2016 to January 21 , 2017 , star a very wide range of actor and actress in its cast lineup . from the original soundtrack to the cast , to the way this drama be film , I could tell that this be go to be a hit from the moment I sit down to watch it . from the very first 5 minute of this drama , I be already hook and ready to ride it out . I remember I watch the first 9 episode in 1 night . an addicting and emotional story of the Goblin , his bride , his friend , his enemy , his sister , and his family be an amazing drama that I really enjoy with all my heart . the story , the tragic story at that , of Goblin , be really compelling . Kim Eun Sook be really a master storyteller . she write character and situation that make your heart skip a beat or even break . I find myself extremely emotionally invest in the love and friendship of the character in this drama . however , I will be honest , I do n’t know if I actually like our main female lead until about episode 11 , I be on the fence about she , but in the end , I do really enjoy she . there be no character that I think be poorly write or not worth the emotional investment , I find each of they to be extremely well think out and very realistic . well , as realistic as you can get for a fantasy drama that be . this drama have so much go for it . it be literally the most aesthetically pleasing drama I have ever watch . the cinematography , the lighting , the color correction , just everything be so beautiful . the way they make this drama look fit the fantasy aesthetic of the drama as well , everything seem so dream and wonderland like . the original soundtrack for this drama do have I on the fence for a while as well . I be wonder if I really enjoy the music for the drama or not , but in the end , I find myself hum and singe along to all the song . they all fit the drama well and put a certain tone and mood to each scene which be what I always say I want . I love ost that can give I song to sing later in life and that make the scene more impactful , and it give I both . the acting in this drama be fantastic for the most part , there be one part where I be iffy about it , but it be a really minor character cry so I will let that slide . Gong Yoo be fantastic , it be great to see he in another drama , not just movie , since big which be a total flop for I . I have always think we be a great actor and that big be a bad choice on his part . perhaps that be why he have stray away from drama for a few year , but I be glad to see he back in action . his sad smile and his eye always fill with pain be really convincing and I hope I see he in more and more drama now that he be back in the drama game . it be my first time encounter Kim Go Eun , I know that her first drama be cheese in the Trap which I know a lot of people love , but I also hear the ending to the drama be pretty lame , so I have yet to go and see it . she be a young woman , my age ( I ’m try to say I ’m young at 26 lol ) . I do have question about my like for her character at time , but I think she do a fantastic job either way . Lee Dong Wook never let I down , he always bring his A game , and I be happy to see he again after my long drama hiatus . his character be possibly my favorite , I feel his pain and I love the way his character develop throughout the entire drama itself . he be just great and there really be n’t more to say about that . Yoo in Na surprise I , I really like she . the last drama I watch she in be you who come from the Stars which I actually do n’t remember she in , so I do n’t know what that say about her role . all I can remember be Queen in Hyun ’s Man which I be really not that impressed with , so I ’m kind of happy to be discover she like she be fresh and new in my mind . overall , the acting be just fantastic and everyone portray their character well . this drama be an emotional roller coaster . from laugh to tear within the same episode , this drama really have a way with play with your emotion . you can get extremely invest in the character of this drama and you hope and pray for a happy ending for they all , and I find myself truly infatuated with it . from the scenery to the story itself , and the music that will forever be ingrain in my mind , the drama be just plain old fantastic . this time , the hype train do n’t let I down , and I be proud of it for that . there be drama out there that be truly worth the hype . I would assume that everyone have already see this drama . but , if you have n’t I hope that you will settle down for 16 episode of pure fantasy , magic , and beauty that this drama have to offer . it be worth the watch and worth a re - watch while you be at it . it be just a drama every korean drama should watch ... great cast , great story line , different from the usual kdrama ish . it be just a fresh drama I will highly recommend . if you want to watch this drama , be ready for an emotional rollercoaster ! this be the first drama that make I cry a lot , but also laugh a lot . it combine both dramatic and funny element wonderfully . spoiler ahead : the cast and acting be a+ ! ! I be really happy to see Sungjae in a drama and I be so happy he be such a great actor ! I usually be a little skeptical when I see idol actor because I \\'ve see some who be n\\'t that good , but he be really great and I be happy for him!Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook be exceptional ! while I be n\\'t that impressed with Lee Dong Wook \\'s acting in Hotel King , I find it to be exceptional in this drama and I feel like he improve a lot ! his friendship with the goblin be hilarious and wonderful , I love it!This be the first drama with Kim Go Eun I watch and she be great , I think she do a good job and I will surely watch other drama in which she played!Before Goblin , I know Gong Yoo from Coffee Prince and I ca n\\'t say I have any opinion on he , but after this , I be in love ! his ability of convey emotion be fantastic!I know Yoo in Na from \\' my love from another Star \\' and I could n\\'t really form an opinion on she , especially since I ca n\\'t say I be impressed with her acting , but I really like she in this drama!The subject be a new an interesting one for I , but I could n\\'t really understand why he be curse even after she pull the sword out and summon he back . I would have expect he to age again , but idk . and if you think about the fact that he be curse to lose she in all of her 4 life and then never meet she again , it make it even sadder!overall , it be a wonderful drama and I wholeheartedly recommend it!This first time I be ever write a review on here for a drama , that be how amazing this drama be ! wish I could give it more than a 10/10 ! the cinematography be amazing , the plot be consistent , and their love story beautiful and heart wrench at the same time . I love all the character and their character development and importance towards to the plot as a whole . this drama as officially steal the number one spot for me!i also recently finish watch Goblin : the Lonely and great God . this show be also by tvN. it be beautiful , poignant , lyrical ( to borrow Christina Bertani \\'s descriptor ) , and all around wonderful . it star the always amazing Gong Yoo ( who I first love in my first K - drama , Coffee Prince ) as the Goblin curse with immortality and Kim Go Eun ( who do her television debut in 2016 in cheese in the Trap ) as the Goblin \\'s bride , who can see ghost and be the only one who can break his curse . it also star Lee Dong Wook ( who , I will be perfectly honest , I feel in love with while watch he on the variety show roommate and have love in everything I \\'ve see he in ) who play a grim Reaper and his love interest be play by the very beautiful Yoo in Na ( who I \\'ve see in several show and I be very glad she finally get to play a character who be not an utter bitch ) . there be no one on this planet who be as good at the wound , kick puppy look as Lee Dong Wook . you just want to hug he and carry he around in your pocket . I give this drama 5 out of 5 on DramaFever ( where I watch it ) and 10 out of 10 on MyDramaLIst . I \\'d give it 1000 out of 1000 , even . the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper be amazing and would make this drama a joy to watch even if everything else in it suck . luckily , nothing in it suck . except maybe the age difference between the Goblin and his bride . but give how chaste k - drama romance be , I be easily able to give that a pass . :) Goblin be a good drama , but even though I give it a 9 , it be not the good in other way . I \\'ll talk about what be good about the drama first , then I \\'ll talk about what I dislike about the drama . CharactersThe character be all great , especially the two male lead . their interaction with each other be especially entertaining . I ca n\\'t say for sure that I really dislike any of the character , though I think I like the second lead well than the male lead . they be more entertaining and they make a little more sense than the main lead , which I will get back to later . ActorsI love every one of the actor . usually there be an actor I hate , but not in this drama . they be all enjoyable to watch and they all do a splendid job . PlotThe story be interesting , especially with the grim reaper stuff . in the end I kind of wish that the way life and death work in the show would work similarly in real life too . the plot always keep I interested throughout the show and there be a lot of cliff hanger . stupid plot device be use sparingly and they partially make sense . VisualsThe cinematography be fantastic . even if you do n\\'t like everything else about this show , you will just like look at it . it be beautiful and a sight for sore eye . MusicI love the majority of the music in this show and I \\'ve listen to many of the song multiple time . the soundtrack really stand out and I do n\\'t think I really dislike any of the song . what I DislikedI feel absolutely no chemistry between the male lead , personally . I think they make great friend , but I always grimace at any romantic moment . I just could n\\'t see they together romantically . I see they as inseparable friend , but no more than that . also , the main male lead kind of irritated I . he be suppose to be like 800 + year old but he act like a child . also , you can not tell I that he never fall in love with anyone until he meet the main female lead . I think it be an excuse to blame his childlike behavior on his personality . in you who come from the Stars , the main male lead have lead a similarly long life like the main lead of Goblin , but he be not childish in any name of the word . I feel that his personality be far more realistic for someone that have live for a long time . as a character the main lead of Goblin be great , but when you realize how long he be live he just do n\\'t make sense . OverallOf course I recommend that you watch Goblin . overall it be a really good show and there be plenty of reason to watch it despite my negative comment at the end . give it a try and you \\'ll probably like it . i’m sorry but I really be look forward to watch this drama but I be let down . just feel that the story be very ... dull ? ? or for I it be the main couple that make I feel this drama be not great . I have already find out the answer like in the first few episode and find it to be quite predictable ... I could figure out what happen in the past which be reveal later in the series .... some positive thing about this drama be the support character and the music my GOD love all the music ! ! the support character be amazing and their acting be awesome . I love the second couple and I love their chemistry ! I feel that they steal the show . the humour be also top notch I must say hehejust wish the storyline be a bit well because I know the audience be much smart than the writer may have think ? ? ? I do n’t know it ’ just my opinion . this may be harsh but the main female actress really put I off any of her other drama she be in . so many time I feel like drop this drama but keep on watch for the music and the support cast . just reckon Goblin in general be overrated . this be my second Kdrama review and I try to keep it short . Goblin be a must watch k - drama , but take slow . not in once , because of the complicated story of the character . my fact be here : Positive:- great storyline - one of a kind in k - drama till now . I learn a lot about korean people \\'s beliefs.- Great friendship between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook . I love every moment of their communication . it seem they be friend in real life- great chemistry between Lee Dong Wook and Yoo in Na . the love between their character be very well act as if they be couple in real life . I love every moment of their relationship.- the Goblin character be really complicated and I like it very much .. it be well play . but I fall for grim Reaper Character - it;s also very complicted and I love it in every single moment even more.- the emotion that Gong Yoo and Yoo in Na be like   they be real brother and sister .   they be great actor and so be Lee Dong Wook.- no loophole and more realistic ending .. negative:- lack of Chemistry between the goblin and his bride . mostly of her part , the actress Kim Go Eun just do n\\'t do well in my opinon . she do n\\'t put her heart in the role and it seem out of place .   this be way I do n\\'t give 10 to this drama .   when Gong Yoo show passion and deep emotion , she do n\\'t respond and it seem force . I do n\\'t think I will watch another drama with Kim Go eun.- time loop withous some kind of explaination what happen those years- Yoo in Na part with grim reaper . I could n\\'t understand if she die after she \" leave \" \" . if she didn;t die why nobody look for her?I like Goblin I watch it slow to understand well the thing . so , if you wonder to watch it , do it , but take 1 or 2 episode per day for example . the producer and writer of this drama be great , but they should n\\'t concentrate too much on the tear . character move on with their life , that should be show . I   will rewatch this drama some time in the future . love this drama!every thing be perfect , character , acting skill , feeling , music . I be just sad that it have already finish , I just want to watch it again . the romance be like a smooth poetry.un drama super un mélange romance / fantastique super bien fait pourtant au début j\\'ai eu un peu peur avec l\\'historique sanglant mais part la suite pas déçu sauf la fin j\\'aurais aimer une autre meme si elle est bien.commentaire traduit aussi en anglais pour que tous le monde comprennent . no drama super - un novel fantastic / great fantastic well do so early in the beginning I get little no fear with the bloody historical but part the follow not disappoint except the end I would love even if another one be fine . it be too good to put in word really ... the story be perfect , the cast be too; ... it do start out a little slow , but by episode 3 there be so many twist and turn and it just make you want more .... I enjoy every single bit of it , and be quite different from your typical drama , maybe cus there be a magical kind of element to it?i would definitely recommend and watch again!At First I be n\\'t very edger to try it at all . wait till it have like 5 ep then I start it . I wish I do n\\'t ! ! it be rlly hard to wait for more . the plot be write in splendid way . some plot twist will leave u speechless , the character all be cute / adorable it make it hard to hate any of they ( I think the actor do a really good job ) , and romance be really sweet and heartwarming , the feel in DIS be real . I ca nt help but give everything a 10.os pontos mais altos de Goblin são : a trilha sonora , q é uma das melhore , se não a melhor trilha sonora em Doramas q já escutei na vida , a arte   visual e a fotografia , que são belíssima , os efeitos especiai , que são incríveis e não deixam em nada a desejar , a incrível atuação da sunny , que de longe e a melhor personagem do Dorama , ah , o enredo tbm é bem interessante . Agora os pontos negativos e que I incomodaram bastante , algun furos de roteiro idiota , a morte mais nada a ver da protagonista , sério eu fiquei de bobeira como aquilo foi forçado e a atuação medíocre do Dong Wook ou \" grim Reaper \" , um personagem com bastante potencial , mas com um crescimento quase nulo é de é personalidade rasa , sério , não sei o q as menina pagam tanto pau pra esse cara!Cinematography : AwesomeStory : so sad love itScript : good ... cast : awesomeNote : lot of funny and sad moment in the story for sure ... there be also a lot of very slow but sweet moment tooi think a very long time about if I should watch this drama or not . and now I have to say I should n\\'t have watch it . not because it be bad but because I have a problem know . the drama result in a special interest in some of the Actors ( especially one of them).story : after I have watch most of Kim Eunsooks drama I be excited when Goblin be first announce . but then there be the casting . although I like the story from the beginning I do n\\'t know if I should watch the drama . but then I read many positive about it and so I give it a chance . the story be about a goblin , but I be more interested in the story about the Grim Reaper . I love grim Reapers . I do n\\'t know why but every time I think about fantasy story , I think about the grim Reaper o.o . act / cast : when I heart of the Cast I be n\\'t very excited to watch Goblin . I will begin with Kim Goeun . I do n\\'t know she very well , but I use to watch cheese in the trap and drop it after one episode , because of Kim Goeun . I do n\\'t know if it be her character or her acting , but I could n\\'t stand it . so her casting be n\\'t a reason for I to watch the drama . but in the end I have to admit that she be a very good actress . her Character be one of those who grow from episode to episode . at first I do n\\'t like her Euntak , but after a few episode I like she . Kim Goeun play the role very emotional and the role be sure very hard to play . but she make the good of it . the last drama of Gong Yoo I have watch be big ... and I drop it after a few episode . it be n\\'t because of he but because of the story and the female lead . but he be n\\'t so good , that I \\'ve watch it for he . the role of an over 900 year old goblin who be tired to live but have no other choice suit he very well . the big age gap between Kim Goeun and he do n\\'t annoy . he do n\\'t look like his age and his character who sometimes can be cute and childish be funny and give fresh wind . Gong Yoo be a very great actor and I hope his future role will suit he as well as this one . next up be Yoo Inna . I watch Queen Inhyun \\'s Man and a little bit of one more happy ending . the first be very good , the latter be bad , so I drop it . in Goblin she play a Chicken restaurant owner . she remember I a little bit of her role in Queen Inhyun \\'s Man . maybe I like her role because of this so much . her Scenes with Lee Dongwook be so intensive and the chemistry be the good . her Acting be amazing in this drama , the most in the second half of the drama . now I come to my favourite character and actor in the whole drama . Lee Dongwook ... I watch he first in one of my first K - Dramas ( my Girl ) where I like he ( but there be also Lee Junki v.v ) . then there be scent of a woman , where he break my heart into piece because his acting be perfect . after that drama I lose he out of my eye . I begin this drama because I want to see he again , but I think he would be the second lead . Kim Eunsook be wonderful . after descendant of the Sun , a second time she spare we   with a second lead syndrome . thank you so much ! Lee Dongwook act as a grim reaper who ca n\\'t remember his past life . his bromance with the Goblin be funny and excellent . the Chemistry between the two actor be very very good . Lee Dongwooks acting skill in Goblin surpass his skill in scent of a Woman . I do n\\'t know it would be poosible but the role of a grim Reaper and his chemstry with Gong Yoo and of course Yoo Inna be amazing . I love this Oppa because he wake up feeling . if he cry I want to cry , too . if he laugh , I want to laugh , too . but the most of the Time I want to give he a big hug . music : the soundtrack be very good . I love the song wish by Urban Zakapa the most . but Soyus OST be very good , too . rewatch value : very high , but for now I want to watch Lee Dong wook other drama , I do n\\'t watch . this drama be so amazing ! I ca n\\'t even express with my word how I feel about this drama . it have everything you could want , drama , romance , sorrow , happiness , plot twist , and so much more . the music be beautiful , it always fight perfectly with the scene it be choose for . I probably go though at lease 3 box of tissue from my happy and sad tear . if your not into historical drama the only part that be historical be at the beginning to set up the background of Kim Shin and etc . the cast all be perfect for their choose part . I find the act superb . personally my favorite character be the grim Reaper . as you progress in the episode you bond deeply with each character as their story be lay out in front of you . different obstacle arise for the character and you get to see they get though it and it be dramatic all the way . the ending be well rounded and perfectly execute . it do n\\'t leave I unsatisfied or confuse at all . I only have good thing to say about this drama and it will forever be my number one favorite . highly recommend everyone to watch this because it , you wo n\\'t regret it . thank for read my review this far , if you have ! :) Cinematography - 10acting - 9plot - 8the first episode be impressive -- the director be able to cover a large time frame and maintain the continuity of the story .   that episode set the stage for the drama .   now , mind you , they be actor and adult , the couple \\' age gap should not deter your judgement of watch a spectacular drama . the actor / actress   be all amazing , I mean you can just really feel the sadness , the distress , the sorrow and then the sweetness ( that do not go overboard to childishness ) , the happiness , the camaraderie ... add to this , this be a great comeback of Gong Yoo to drama land and when he have his sad moment in teh drama you just want to tell he to not be sad because his face just make you \" aawww , do n\\'t be sad ... \" . this drama be so boring and many scene keep repeat like the historical event KIM SUN got kill . its like the flashback repeat many many time . the only interesting I wanna see and anticipate be the scene between WANG YEO and KIM SUN . its quite refreshing and interesting . the chemistry betweeen they both be gr8.Kim shin look like lack of emotion and in many scene he choose to keep quiet and lack of reaction . the joke scene be like be force . appreciate writer care about the working on the final episode . everything be perfect but ................. end be a little let down , but still this be the best drama I \\'ve see as of the present . I can say with 100 % confidence this be hand down the good drama I \\'ve ever see and I \\'ve see at least 50 to 60 so far . the cast be beyond amazing , the plot keep you on your toe and make you cry , laugh , cringe and smile like crazy . the story be beautiful and mysterious and it be the most unique storyline . I be beyond heartbroken that the show be over . everyone watch goblin!this drama be great!!!!have you ever cry because of a movie / drama ? well I promise you that after watch this drama you will have many mixed emotion through just one episode.nothe special.oh there be , in other ddrama the villain end up in jail , in here they live a happy life more happy than the goblin withhout worry and the goblin will help if they meet trouble.the only good thing about this be the actor / actress , the place and music ... as for the story pretty much the same like other k - drama with the villain actually always near ml , the villain forgive , the villain not regret what they have do , a dark human nature unnfulfille without resentment just because from all the bad thing there be a little goood thing . the 1st couple can not have a normal relationship even after all the trouble but the 2nd couple can have relationship with well enviroment and clear mind like they have not do a thing wrong just like that.at the end this show be like watch top moment in social medium , they be addicting because cute / the music good / the dance good / what the person do interesting but there be no story in it , if there be ! it be just a story to make the moment connectng in natural way . absolutely one of my favorite drama ! I ’ve watch drama three time now ! lol !   the comedic chemistry between the two maleactor have I in stitch ! their banterswere hilarious ! I enjoy the twist and turn of the story , and lose many sleep try to watch episodes!The act and storyline be fantastic !   I believe this have to be one of the good Kdramas I ’ve watched!The OST contain my favorite song ! I hope this drama win many award , include act and OST!https://m.youtube.com / watch?v = pcKR0LPwoYshttps://m.youtube.com / watch?v = yUo9WMPmEpEOkay I ’m do bawl my eye out now . but man . oh . my . God . I get it now . I understand all the high rating . I understand the love for this drama . I understand it all . this drama be just too high quality for I . it be a masterpiece , through and through . everything about it . a few points:- stunning scenery & cinematography- gorgeous soundtrack , beautiful ( just put on Winter be Coming.mp3 or and I be Here.mp3 and I ’ll be a wreck)- Quality storyline- slow and steady pacing- great acting- superb chemistry for our main 2 romantic couple ( and bromance couple)I take my time watch this show in order to savour its beauty . this show be such a rollercoaster . since there be a lot of angst , when our character smile , it be like see the sun come out after year of rain . you ’ll have the fluffy scene of all time that you be unprepared for and then more angst come and smack you in the face . but god I love it all - it make I feel so many thing . I have never see two character that encapsulate the word \\' soulmate \\' like Kim Shin and Ji Eun Tak . those lover deserve the world and more . my final thought be the immense satisfaction and gratification for allow myself to watch this paragon of a drama . word can not express how good this drama be . Goblin go above and beyond any drama I have ever see . the acting , the story , the music ; everything be just so superb . I cry my eye out , and I laugh even hard . when I finish this drama ( the first time ) I immediately watch it all over again .   the music be so good that I be still listen to the OST on Spotify a year and a half later .   I fall in love with each and every character like they be real people in my life .   if I could recommend any drama , it would be Goblin .   the only flaw this drama have be that it do n\\'t have even more episode .   we can only hope one day they make a sequel . the second korean show I watch , after CLOY.Goblin be a masterpiece . a show with amazing direction , cast and beautiful music . be a bit off about the crazy age difference between the lead , but oh well . love the bromance , they share amazing chemistry . would love to see they in another show . the lead lady be a very talented actress . love her expression . I love the guy in Train to Busan , and this show make I a fan of him!definitely a worth watch , a bit of a drag for 2 - 3 episode from 8 or so , but overall a good watch!after watch Goblin , I find that the thing I love the most about it be the chemistry between the cast member , and not just the main couple but , for example , between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook .   I think that the OST be very very nice , and at time when I hear it in the background , I feel that it be suitable and make the scene even well . I feel that the story be quite unique and the uniqueness of it be handle well . although I do n\\'t love the ending all that much , I really love the general story and the process to which the ending ws reach , thus I would definitely recommend this drama to anyone who want to watch it . TLDR : the story be great , the end ok , amazing chemistry , would recommendSo much people I know who have reservation in watch this show , but once they watch it its in their top 5 . just give it a go . I \\'ve watch this when it air and in total I \\'ve watch it maybe 9 time now . the character wo n\\'t make any sense in the first few episode   but as the suspense build you \\'ll understand they . and kdrama will do what kdrama do good with your emotion all over the place . so get ready for this rollacoater and sit back and just watch it ffs ! ! and I have to write some other word to fill in the character which I do n\\'t understand why , so you can just forget this part of this essay . peace . Goblin be my first korean drama and the plot catch my attention . it be very well produce , detail orient I may say . I think Gong Yoo , Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In - Na do a really great job . the spotlight , to I at least , be on the relationship between the goblin and the grim reaper . Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In - Na be a great couple full of chemistry . I like the story , I think it be well developed , except for one thing only : they could have explore Kim Go - eun well . her character be way too childish for the age ( I do n\\'t know if it have any difference in Korea , but here in the Eastern 19 yo girl be more mature than that ) . the childish behaviour turn the love story a little weird .   besides that , I think it be a good production and deserve to be watch and appreciate . I have lot of fun . don\\'t hesitate just do It!This entire series be my all - time favorite , my number one ! I have be try to refrain from watch this again because the first time around nothing really fill the void once this show be over . I digress , this show have everything you could ever want , comedy , romance , drama , excitement , evil , character development . it be a masterpiece.!The OTS .... this OTS ... be phenomenal . I can listen to the song in my car while on my way to work . the song just fit so well with the series and just provide a heighten viewing experience . the cast as a whole cohesive be fantastic . they work so well together and make sure the viewer hate , love , and cry with they every time the experienced something new . their craftsmanship just seem so genuine and be quite entertaining to watch . I never give any spoiler in my review and so I wo n\\'t reveal the ending , but I will tell you that this show no matter the ending be worth watch . I appreciate the journey this show take I on and the emotional rollercoaster it was.i be go to give this drama a solid 10 for the plot , but I do nt like some part of the plot ( personal prefrence ) like how the character develop but overall this drama be really good . the theme of the story be great like applause to the writer , but the actor age gap make a bit uncomfortable but I could understand why they choose they ... their chemistry be great , and I be so into they I cry ocean I laugh hysterically.have you watch a drama that make you weep laugh get confused then butterfly in your stomach then again cry , yes complicated I know but that s what I love so much about it .Personally I like the bromance between the male lead :D and I ship it so hard it be so cute , if you be hesitate to watch the drama .. do nt ! you will miss out so much bromance ;D , the grim sense of humor and goblin \\'s hot smile you do nt wanna miss it . the scenery of the drama be 10/10 believe I you will be amazed ... my absolute fav be the music it be so GOOD so good from the first ep till the last .. and that one song for kim kyung hee , ill keep it with meoverall DONT MISS out on this drama you will lose a loti be go to give this drama a solid 10 for the plot , but I do nt like some part of the plot ( personal prefrence ) like how the character develop but overall this drama be really good . the theme of the story be great like applause to the writer , but the actor age gap make a bit uncomfortable but I could understand why they choose they ... their chemistry be great , and I be so into they I cry ocean I laugh hysterically.have you watch a drama that make you weep laugh get confused then butterfly in your stomach then again cry , yes complicated I know but that s what I love so much about it .Personally I like the bromance between the male lead :D and I ship it so hard it be so cute , if you be hesitate to watch the drama .. do nt ! you will miss out so much bromance ;D , the grim sense of humor and goblin \\'s hot smile you do nt wanna miss it . the scenery of the drama be 10/10 believe I you will be amazed ... my absolute fav be the music it be so GOOD so good from the first ep till the last .. and that one song for kim kyung hee , ill keep it with meoverall DONT MISS out on this drama you will lose a lotbeen want to watch this drama for a while and finally manage to finish marathon it now . since I be the type to get easily put off over a series if there be way too much hype over a series by fandom to the point that it dampen one \\'s mood to keep watch . so I be glad that I finally able to enjoy this drama properly . it be great to be able to enjoy the series without have the pressure to have to like it just because a lot of people also love the drama . anyway , I always love a fantasy - theme drama , and Goblin also combine two narrative from the Goryeo period and the modern period and turn it into a beautiful love story . that be enough to make the story interesting and I really love how the writing flow beautifully to flawlessly integrate the three element into a great story . that aside , I love how well the character be write to be so endearing and well - love . I especially love the secondary love story between the Grim Reaper and sunny as well as the complicated relationship between Grim Reaper and the Goblin . which make one ca n\\'t help but keep tune in to see how the three character , whose relationship extend past several lifetime could reconcile with each other once they realize each other \\'s identity . that aside , it be really endearing to see a shy and timid goblin be pair with an awkward and adorable drama - love grim reaper as they try to figure out their place in the world and find out the purpose of their existence while pave their own \\' happy endings\\' . this drama hit I on a different level . it be very emotional and loving . I have never cry or think this much about any kdrama before and trust I I;ve watch a LOT of drama before . just watch IT . you WILLLL NEVVERR regret a thinmggeven though the age gap be kinda weird , it be how it be to be . also grim Reaper be kinda cute I think it would be like a typical love triangle or something but this hit straight on . the plot be SO AMAZSINGNNGN . it go back detally back in the time and their past life contribute to the detail of their old life . ok guy , this be my first time ever to write a review but that one be worth it to I and it really do n\\'t need a second thought to watch it I be tell you guy that drama have everything from laughter to sadness to heart worm love to suspense , will there to many thing to put it in a simple review but I be just say the story and the acting and the filming come together in the right time the music marge in and they make a wonderful combination and the camera work with slow the time at the right moment it just breathtake . watch it and you will see what I be try so hard to describe in that review and know it do n\\'t do justice by it.thank you . M.G.ShanabI have n\\'t be able to find anything that I love as much as Goblin . literally the only complaint I can think of be that the story drag a little bit when I want more elsewhere , so I wish that time be use a little well , but it be really only a criticism when compare to itself because the story be mostly amazing and well paced . other than that , I ca n\\'t think of anything I would change . the acting be amazing , the styling and cinematography be gorgeous , and the OST be hand down my favorite of any drama . don\\'t let the age gap freak you out , it serve a metaphorical purpose in the story ( the motif of the season ) and we as the viewer know that no one be be take advantage of . this be one of those show I have to stop myself from compare every other show to , because if I do , very few thing would measure up . I do n\\'t want to make this review too long so I will just make a quick review . a couple of filler at the start of each episode . they be effective as it remind I of event that happen . it also take I a couple of episode to settle into the story properly but by the 7th/8th episode , I be definitely hooked . I\\'\\'m glad that I do n\\'t drop or put this kdrama on hold . the good episode imo be from episode 9 onwards . the story be really well put together . even though I do n\\'t really know much about how goblin and grim reaper work in this kdrama , I get to learn some thing .. the bromance between the two male lead be great ! haha definitely one of the good in kdrama , no doubt . the acting be another outstanding aspect of this kdrama ! Gong Yoo be such an amazing actor . I remember see my first work of his in Train to Busan . I always find he to be an amazing actor . Dong Wook be someone who could deliver a specific emotion just like that . he have such an expressive face . when he be sad , I be sad too . I be move by his act the most . lead actress   KGE and YIN play their part exceptionally well as well . this whole kdrama be just ethereal . finally , the music be so beautiful . I love all the song I hear . they play a great role in help I feel the emotion as I , a viewer , should be feel at particular scene . if you do n\\'t want to watch this kdrama , at least give the ost a chance because they be absolute masterpiece . I would definitely rewatch this again one day when I have the time . I would probably skip some part ( like the filler ) but I \\'d definitely be in it for the funny scene ^_^BTW Sung Jae do well with his role . it buy some extra fun and ease to all those intense scene . overall , this kdrama be a 9.5 for meThe acting be solid in this .   Gong Yoo \\'s portrayal of Kim Shin be excellently do , especially in the finale .   deep emotion yet not emo throughout . second lead relationship definitely more ship - worthy than the first lead relationship in this drama . to I the story drag , the chemistry be quietly simmer throughout in a beautifully shot drama .   rather than situational conflict , the drama be more about character interaction so rely more heavily on proper acting .   fortunately , the lead be well - cast and meet those expectation . have to force myself to finish this one .   to I slightly overrated but still a good show and worth watch if you have time on your hand . this show be like nothing i d ever see before the casting be amazing . I ca n\\'t imagine anybody else play those roles.it be a great balance between drama , romance , and comedy.only reason I give it a 9 be cause there be some moment that drag out a little long but overall it be an amazing show.the word be great the set fit the character so well and the outside shot be beautiful . I be hesitant to watch this show because a show about a goblin do n\\'t really peak my interest but I m so glad I try . perhaps , the most popular drama these day .. Goblin be everything you \\'d want in a drama .. joy , sorrow , love and separation .. the cast be perfect and nothie less ... Gong Yoo as Kim Shin will make you woe for he in each and every episode and Lee Dong wook be just the cut thing you \\'ll find one the face of the earth . Kim Go eun be kinda hate for this character and receive a lot of mean comment say \" she be ugly \" and all , and let I say this .. everyone who say be just envious idiot , that be all . her character be really good and the chemistry between they be just awe - some ! Lee dong wook and Yoo in Na \\'s relationship be cute and yoo in na ( sunny ) \\'s character be kinda that lovable character but you wish she \\'d be well idk what to say about she :3 the story have a great flow and very very high re - watch value .. trust I every comedy , romantic scene can be watch everyday and you \\'d still not get bored .So , I have always hear this drama be a must once you start in the kdrama world and I finally this week I think ok , why not ? ( I start watch kdrama in 2018 , mind you ) and as I be watch the first episode , I see people comment oh this be my 4th or 7th time watch this drama and I think you have watch the same show over and over that many time ? ? ? well , now after finish it in three day , and after cry bucket of tear , I can say that I understand why someone would watch this again . the acting be amazing . at first I think it be go to be a very heavy drama so I be very surprised and happy by all the humour in it , the bromance between Goblin and the Grim Reaper it be amazing , I love it so much .   the lead be great ... I have my reserve because of the age gap , I like that they keep thing innocent while she be young ...... but still at time it be weird to watch , specially because of how young the actress would act , the skipping , the voice , and it kind of feel like he be act like a father at time too . but despite that , I really feel some great chemistry between they . the music be incredible , the song use for the opening have be etch in my heart , seriously . the scenery and photography be lovely , stunning . I do find the story gripping , contrary to what I have read from some people here .... hence why I finish it in three day . I have to confess I be quite upset by the ending of the lead , I honestly feel that what happen in the second half of the final episode be not necessary ...... someone here say it be basically like they start from scratch and I agree . be the point to break the audience \\'s heart even more ? to teach we a lesson ? I do n\\'t know , I be honestly upset .... I really do n\\'t think it be necessary . you can tell I have just finish watch it and my tear have barely dry , lol . would I watch it again ? most likely ..... in a long time , though . it be a hell of a ride . absolutely intense and emotional . what do you guy think of it???good , but not great .   the cast be flawless !   its not often that a drama \\'s lead and second lead couple be equally strong and with the add bonus of a bromance that be every bit as compelling as the romance . the story be beautiful and well tell , yet something about it just miss the mark for I . I guess I do n\\'t quite understand why the Goblin be be punish so severely . and it be it I , but be there a LOT of cry ? I feel like I cry a LOT .   I do n\\'t mind \" the feel \" , but by episode 9 it start to feel almost gratuitous .   Goblin have many funny scene as well .   the casting be superb !   but be there one episode where at least one character do not cry?I must mention that the OST be amazing and definitely contribute to \" the feel \" .   I look forward to hear never far away each and every episode . 16 episode be perfect and Gobllin be definitely worth a watch , but this be not a drama I would rewatch , not even for certain scene .   good drama , but it be one and do for I . essential for anyone try to get into k - dramas . this drama take I a while to finish because somewhere in the middle make I scared to finish it .. (watch it if you want to know ;) ) but overall , the creativity of this drama be unique and mesmerizing . somewhere between all of the episode make I realize how important life be , and how we should cherish it as if we be go to die tomorrow . ( I know we be in quarantine , but there be still stuff we can do even if we be lock down ) the actor and actress really portrait their character significantly . the story be somewhat similar to the \\' Hotel Del Luna \\' but thing ca n\\'t really be the same especially if it be different character and setting . the cinematography be insane ! ! ! ! , the funny moment with Grim and Goblin be hilarious which be the reason why I start watch this drama .   the end kind of make I confused but I sorta understand where they be go at ... but I wish sunny and \\' KIM WOO BIN \\' have more screen time and more \" date \" . I find their relationship very rom - com -idy than Eun Tak and Goblin . but I still like the romance that they have . the way they first meet , first love , and first sadness .... ? this drama also show I how dedicated he be to Eun Tak , he be patient to wait for she even if he be a \\' LONELY GOD\\'This quote ; \" there be no sadness that last for eternity . there be no love that last for eternity either . \" and Eun Tak vote for \" sad love \" ... this quote tear I up because the commitment she be do be just sooo amazing and a life lesson . I wish that for anyone who be look for love or be in love , I wish for y all to be dedicate as they ... this be true love!!!overall , this make I cry ! , laugh , smile , cringe , and make I jealous xdafter watch this , it inspire I to keep go and push on in life!The comedy in this drama will stay with I forever ! HAHAH!I also love how Deok - Hwa be the pabo person in the drama ... evne though it be mostly grim and Goblin . after watch Sungjae in this drama , I begin to miss \\' we get married \\' with JOY t.tanyway ! this be a fun and memorable moment of I watch GOBLIN.Watching this drama take I almost 4 month HAHAHAHAH.THANK GOD I finish it tho!!!and thank you for the ending <3 .... tear I up but that be a ----- end <3 < 37:40pm 4/6/20post - Goblin feel > > empty . I do n\\'t think Goblin would have be great have it be for the actor and the chemistry between they . who do n\\'t love teleportation to a new country , live comfortably in a house make for a millionaire , know the grim reaper by first name?scene will have you laugh and cry uncontrollably , leave you with a melancholic feeling once the show end . I would definitely recommend this show , not only for the amazing cinematography but also for the well - sequence soundtrack . a fairy - tale never to be forget . ? ? I have see a few drama but this be still the good of all!the plot be so creativethe song be to love even to put in itunes!The actor be amazing ! ! ! ; - ; grim reaper be so handsomethe quality of the serie be very good!Gotta love it get ta rewatch over and over again!!!Troche sie meczyeam . Watki poboczne byly czesto ciekawsze niz ten glowny . Duzo ladnych scen . Glówna bohaterka irytujaca I dziecinna . Postaci Goblina i Zniwiarza bardzo dobre . I know this be a melodrama to heavy drama series but I have to say I laugh more than I cry watch this drama . grim reaper have no name and business card be my favorite , I enjoy the scene of grim Reaper - Kim Shin , -Yoo Deok - hwa and Ji Eun - tak fun moment inside their house . at first I be not sure how to feel about the main lead , but their acting make I fall in love with their character . they be able to show how love can lighten up even the hard situation in life . I also like how bold they be in show their feeling to each other . I love that how they feel be be see from their face in their acting . I love Gon Yoo \\'s acting esp when he be flutter :) and who would not love to watch 3 good - look male lead and a cute lead lady . I love every episode of this drama , especially ost , cast , main character . every single moment be beautifully show . love story and chemistry be amazing ! I love first couple \\'s romance , it be naturally and I feel they understand each other great . second couple \\'s romance be also great , otherwise it could n\\'t be , there be Lee Dong Wook . :) in this genre this be one of the most lovable and watchable drama and I advice everyone to watch this drama . Goblin be definitely worth the watch as the story be very unique - I do n\\'t think that I would enjoy it so much . despite the episode be very long ( which it do n\\'t feel like ) , it really be enjoyable . the low rewatch value be due to the fact that the episode be 1hr and 30mins long , but this should not refrain you from watch it . I think it be a must - see . I would rate the cast as 12/10 ... but you know it do n\\'t work like that . it be really fun to recognise the reference make about actual kdrama actor and even some kpop group ^_^this ... there no word to describe this drama . it be the good drama I have ever see . it have be on my watch list ever since I first hear about it last year , and be nt really that interested . but I be hugely mistaken . drop what ever you be watch and go watch Goblin now ! ! ! the cast where beautiful , the music be amazing , it be just all round amazing , I shed so many tear for this show , either of saddness and happiness . I hope to who ever watch it next or be currently watch it , that you enjoy and love just as much as I do . beautiful!!!!definate re watch . overall an excellent show with great music . story lag at time and I think they do one thing too many but it be easy to over look . I do nt expect it to be so funny .   the romance be great , both couple . I find myself think about they from time to time and reminisce about how much I enjoy they be together . the acting be phenomenal . I love the lead so much . look forward to watch more of they elsewhere . I honestly say that Goblin be one of my favorite korean drama ! I say this be not because I like korean drama , but from all korean drama goblin be on top 5 drama list which I love ! of the 50 + korean drama I \\'ve seen.well I love everything about this drama also the story be very good write \\xa0 and mostly I love be music in this drama dude music be the reason make I continue watch it and acting be fantastic and also romance between main lead be very sweet and I highly recommend u to watch it and u will not regret watch this drama for 10/10 and their be a lot k - drama \\'s I have watch it but this one be the good for I guy and all u have to do be start watch it now and u will have great time watch it .. go now start watch it do n\\'t waste ur time .. best korean drama of the year ! ! already re - watch and its totally worthy to be re - watch again . so perfect ! ! I even fall in love with the support character . every episode be so good , I do n\\'t want it to end!!!intereste drama about the folklore of Dokkaebi . I have my reservation , ironically because this be a hit . I do n\\'t enjoy hit like DOTS so I be quite skeptical about this drama too . watch it anyway and enjoy it thoroughly:)firstly , all the logic fall into place nicely and the flow of the drama be great , so I can follow and immerse into the story quite well . ( except for that part of Sunny \\'s restaurant business .. ) secondly , the character be plan out nicely and uniquely interesting . lastly , the bromance , womance , romance and kinship be display appropriately . I be glad that there be relationship other than romance , make the story much for believable . I enjoy the story maybe except that the drama do a lot of recap so I have to fast forward every time there be one . I do n\\'t quite believe that there will be chemistry between the two lead , but they really impress I ! ! ! sunny and grim Reaper also display their subtle chemistry that I like a lot . I be totally take in by grim Reaper ! ! ! all other character really perform well and deserve a 10/10 ( include those not - so - cameo CAMEOS)All the ost be great , just that the ( airy ) track by Soyou be n\\'t quite enjoyable for I . like you be try to immerse in the emotion then the breathy sound come in ( maybe its just me)all in all , just watch it!!!There be a compelling story , interesting character , a good bromance , comedy and a tragic romance . the soundtrack , editing , production value , costume , food and location be all top notch . this be quality all around , and do very well . the 2 male lead have a genuine bromance go on , load of chemistry , so much a viewer could feel it . these 2 be hilarious and look very different . the Goblin look like the cute guy from next door but the Gong Yoo \\'s charisma be so off the chart , it be virtually impossible to not like he and thus the character he play . you ca n\\'t buy that . he have it .     Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper be classically handsome with sexy bedroom eye . he literally smolder while exude tall , handsome and mysterious vibe . irresistible really . with this amount of eye candy and camaraderie , what be not to love?as a bonus , both these actor make every item of clothing they wear look appeal , sleek , chic and sexy . from long , tailor coat and beautiful knit sweater to perfectly iron pant , I do n\\'t think I \\'ve ever see a drama where I noticed the cut and quality of clothe on the main actor because I feel they enhance the look / feel of the clothe . just gorgeous . these 2 could easily make a living as male model , I bet they could even make a sack look expensive and sexy . mmmm . the female lead clothe be nice . and I have to give kudo to Yoo in Na who play sunny for make her square platform high heel look sexy as work shoe ( impractical in real life but hey those shoe look great ) . all in all the fashion in this show be top notch , kudo to the stylist . the story actually play out very well . I could have use way less flashback but it be okay . the soundtrack meld seamlessly with the scene they be use in . the song be ear candy and sentimental . there be 2 set of romance and both be very well do . the 4 lead have good chemistry together . as a viewer I be actively root for both couple to get together as I think they need some long term happiness not just short burst of joy . if a drama get I invest , it be a good drama . all the acting be fantastic , even the side and small character . the location choose for this show be varied and high quality . the Goblin \\'s house for example , each room have a different feel , style and vibe . canadian scenery set be wonderful . the field of buckwheat flower . snow . all in all the production budget spend on location , costume , prop and special effect be well use . it work to transport the viewer to different locale . they manage to sneak in a fair amount of product placement too - visit Canada . eat a steak there and bring back a maple leaf and be that a bottle of canadian Maple Syrup ? there be a lot of car feature , and one subtle / prominent Tag Haeur watch . also , for some strange reason , watch this will make you crave steak , wine , Soju and Olive Chicken . I do n\\'t know why . actually I do know why , but I ca n\\'t help it . overall this be an almost perfect ( editing could be tight ) blend of historical plus modern rom com with a dash of bromance throw in . it be a must watch for those who like great korean drama . watch it no question . ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?'"
